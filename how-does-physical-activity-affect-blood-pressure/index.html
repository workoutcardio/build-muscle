<p>Increasing physical activity and exercise Blood pressure ranging from 60 to 75 mmhg (dbp) and 76 to 100 mmhg (sbp), equal to or below 25th percentile, is considered for the low risk pressure group (lbp), and pressure range from 85 to 100 mmhg (dbp) and 120 to 140 mmhg (sbp), equal to or greater than 95th percentile, is considered for the high risk or. Studies show that by reducing systolic blood pressure by 5 mmhg, deaths from strokes can be reduced by 14% and deaths from coronary heart disease can be decreased by 9%. Drinking alcohol and using a sauna isn’t a good combination either, so don’t mix the two.</p>

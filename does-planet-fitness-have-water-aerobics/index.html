Planet fitness does not have a pool, but they do offer swimming lessons and classes. If they add a pool, it will raise their costs, and they will have to transfer this cost to the consumer. Planet fitness aims to provide a gym that has affordable rates. Although they may not provide a lot of extras, such as towels, planet fitness still goes above and beyond to ensure its members have a good experience.

Longterm Prognostic Value of Cardiac MRI Left Atrial Strain in ST From pubs.rsna.org
Depending on the size of the area being scanned and how many images are taken, the whole procedure will take 15 to 90 minutes. Cardiac mri images show the parts of your heart and any damage to specific areas. In this case, it may take longer to receive information on it.

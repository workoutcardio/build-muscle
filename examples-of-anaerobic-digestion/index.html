<p>The process (which is known as âadâ) is an increasingly attractive waste and biofuel crop treatment process in which both pollution control and energy recovery can be achieved. For example, material may be fed into a reactor in distinct batches, or in a continuous flow. These processes take place in an enclosed building and involve the breakdown of organic material in a sealed vessel called a digester. Anaerobic digestion is a series of biological reactions whereby microorganisms break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, with biogas its chief result.

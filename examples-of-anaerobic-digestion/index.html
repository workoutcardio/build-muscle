<p>The anaerobic process of digestion is the increasingly attractive waste and biofuel crop treatment process in which both pollution control and energy recovery can be achieved. Materials high in organic content, such as municipal wastewater, livestock waste, agricultural waste, and food wastes, may all undergo anaerobic digestion. The result is known as renewable energy or alternative energy. These organisms promote a number of chemical processes in converting the biomass to biogas. Anaerobic Digestion Plant Design.</p>

<p>The process (which is known as “ad”) is an increasingly attractive waste and biofuel crop treatment process in which both pollution control and energy recovery can be achieved. For example, material may be fed into a reactor in distinct batches, or in a continuous flow. These processes take place in an enclosed building and involve the breakdown of organic material in a sealed vessel called a digester. Anaerobic digestion is a series of biological reactions whereby microorganisms break down organic matter in the absence of oxygen, with biogas its chief result.

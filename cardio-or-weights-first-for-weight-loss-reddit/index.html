By lifting weights first before your cardio you’ll also perform better lifts, with better form.

Besides a good diet and low calorie intake i&#39;m just curious what most people do on a daily basis to assist with weight loss. Weight lifting, on the other hand, can burn up to 300 calories per hour—and that’s if the weight lifting is incredibly vigorous.

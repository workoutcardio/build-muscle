Body systems and homeostasis From slideshare.net
One of the main homeostatic functions of the respiratory system is the gas exchange that occurs in the alveoli in the lungs. The stomach is a muscular pouch where food is held until it can be processed by the small intestine. Lymph nodes filter harmful bacteria and other pathogens from the lymph, preventing them from reaching the blood and circulating throughout the body. Does every system in the body help maintain homeostasis?

<p>The respiratory system helps maintain homeostasis by regulating the intake of air into the body and by removing carbon dioxide from the blood, which in turn assists the circulatory system's function and many other operations in the body. One of the main homeostatic functions of the respiratory system is the gas exchange that occurs in the alveoli in the lungs. Your body ensures that the water content it contains does not become too concentrated or too dilated, and kidneys help in this case by getting rid of excess ions from the blood.

<p>The ingumentary system/skin helps to maintain homeostasis because it produces vitamin d, protects the body from the outside, and it helps to cool the body when it is overheated. One of the main homeostatic functions of the respiratory system is the gas exchange that occurs in the alveoli in the lungs. Does every system in the body help maintain homeostasis? Lymph nodes filter harmful bacteria and other pathogens from the lymph, preventing them from reaching the blood and circulating throughout the body. Lymphatic &amp; Immune System.</p>

<p>Less energetically expensive, but no less important, roles in the maintenance of homeostasis include the lymphatic systemâs ability to fight infection, the respiratory systemâs maintenance of oxygen and proper ph. The respiratory system helps maintain homeostasis by regulating the intake of air into the body and by removing carbon dioxide from the blood, which in turn assists the circulatory system's function and many other operations in the body.

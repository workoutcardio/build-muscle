Why Does Our Heart Rate Increase During Exercise? From livestrong.com
When exercise intensity increases the amount of blood also increased because of more nutrients and oxygen required for muscles to function. This is why when we exercise both pulse/heart rate and breathing rate increase. But if you&#39;re doing aerobics or cardiovascular exercise (like running, bicycling, or rowing) you are still using one muscle in particular &amp;md your heart is a muscle. Pulse rate is an indication of your heart rate as your arteries expand each time the ventricles pump blood out of the heart.

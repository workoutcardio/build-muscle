Lab Report Handbook Biology Research Guides at Massachusetts From library.mcla.edu
In my experiment i will be looking at how exercise affects the pulse rate of the individual. Heart rate is defined as the amount of times a person&#39;s heart beats in one minute. According to the cleveland clinic, a normal pulse rate for an adult older than 18 years varies from 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm) while at rest and up a maximum of 200 bpm during vigorous exercise, depending on age and fitness level. Use the stethoscopes and timers to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds.

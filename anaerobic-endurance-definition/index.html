What Is Aerobic Exercise? Definition, Benefits &amp; Examples Video From study.com
The anaerobic threshold is the lowest intensity of exercise at which the production of lactate exceeds the body’s ability to utilize lactate as fuel in aerobic metabolism. Immediate anaerobic energy system, and; During exercise, the oxygen consumption above which aerobic energy production is supplemented by anaerobic mechanisms, causing a sustained increase in lactate and metabolic acidosis, is termed the anaerobic threshold (at). With the increase of training equipment for endurance exercises in the last 10 years or so the role of aerobic and anaerobic threshold has moved from common language used by elite and sub elite endurance athletes to terminology used by many of those who compete at a much lower level or indeed participate in endurance sport purely as recreational pursuit to keep.

Sample activities include walking, jogging, swimming, and cycling. Aerobic exercise is cardiovascular conditioning that strengthens both your heart and lungs. Aerobic definition, (of an organism or tissue) requiring the presence of air or free oxygen for life. It is a cyclic aerobic process taking place in the matrix of mitochondria to break down pyruvic acid into carbon dioxide in the presence of certain enzymes.

<p>Aerobic exercise is a type of physical activity that uses your large muscle groups and stimulates your cardio output. The work periods would usually exceed several minutes and the rest periods would be active but at a lower intensity. In the aerobic system energy (atp) is produced through pyruvic acid and lipid/protein fragments entering the kreb cycle and the electron transport cycle (mcardle, 1991). This energy system can be developed with various types of training. Differents Between Aerobic &amp; Anaerobic Exercise? Types &amp; Examples.</p>

<p>The presence of serum anticardiolipin (acl) antibody without clinical symptoms does not support a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). When antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can form. What does it mean if your anticardiolipin ab,igg,qn result is too low? Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages.</p>

<p>What causes high cardiolipin ab igm? When antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can form. They are often measured to help diagnose different conditions, such as infections, immunodeficiency, autoimmune disease, and certain types of cancer. A cardiolipin antibody test detects cardiolipin antibodies in the blood. Some RE patients have additional potentiallypathogenic autoimmune ab's.</p>

<p>Beta2 glycoprotein 1 is the protein in the body to which anticardiolipin antibodies bind, and it is also possible to measure antibodies to beta2. High levels of the igm isotype are associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a condition in which an individualâs immune system attacks their red blood cells.

<p>The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). There are three types of anticardiolipin antibodies: I have included the bloodwork of the cardiolipin tests. Also what the lupus anticoagulant test results mean.  Results of antiPS/PT antibodies.

<p>Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. Autoimmune antibodies can be formed against natural (normal) cell surface proteins.when this happens, adverse effects can occur. A negative result means only that the cardiolipin antibody class tested (igg, igm, and/or iga) is not present at this time. The test measures igg and igm levels. Lupus anticoagulants.</p>

<p>The test measures the level of the antiphospholipid antibodies in the blood. A positive result supports the diagnosis only in the presence of thrombosis or fetal loss.

<p>The igm antibody is one of the five subcategories of antibodies and it is found both in the blood and the lymph. An cardiolipin igm test looks for a certain type of antibody in your blood. The test requires a blood sample that is usually taken from a vein in the arm. Persistence is defined as moderate or high levels of igg and/or igm cl antibodies detected in two or more.

<p>The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood clotting, autoimmune diseases like lupus, or repeated miscarriages. An antibody is a substance in your blood that helps fight off infection. Cardiolipin antibodies are the most common antiphospholipid antibody, a group of autoantibodies associated with excessive clotting and autoimmune diseases, such as lupus. Beta2 glycoprotein 1 is the protein in the body to which anticardiolipin antibodies bind, and it is also possible to measure antibodies to beta2.

<p>An easy way to estimate intensity of activities is through a method called the “talk test”. Rpe is a measure of physical activity intensity level which relies upon the individual’s personal perception of how much effort is being exerted during activity.although this measure is somewhat subjective, the borg rating of perceived exertion scale (figure 1) appears to be a reasonably accurate estimate of heart rate during physical. This method is a simple, practical way for individuals to measure their activity intensity. For older individuals, the classification of activity intensity might be higher.

<p>The world health organization defines a moderate intensity activity is one that increases a person's heart rate. Rpe is a measure of physical activity intensity level which relies upon the individual’s personal perception of how much effort is being exerted during activity.although this measure is somewhat subjective, the borg rating of perceived exertion scale (figure 1) appears to be a reasonably accurate estimate of heart rate during physical. When using relative intensity, people pay attention to how physical activity affects their heart rate and breathing.

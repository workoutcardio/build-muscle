What Causes Esophageal Sphincter Pain? (with pictures) From wisegeek.com
One of the functions of the sphincter is to regulate the amount of chyme that is released into the duodenum, allowing maximum absorption of nutrients. Sphincters are circular muscles that serve as valves to open and close certain parts of the body. This can lead to acid reflux (gerd) or lpr. A sphincter is a circular muscle that normally maintains constriction of a natural body passage or orifice and which relaxes as required by normal physiological functioning.

A sphincter is a circular muscle that normally maintains constriction of a natural body passage or orifice and which relaxes as required by normal physiological functioning. If this sphincter is too tight or obstructed, it can cause a delay in the stomach emptying as quickly as it should.

<p>For example, the digestive system has several sphincters that regulate the passage of fluid and food from the mouth to the stomach, through the intestines, and out the anus. The weakened sphincter cannot withstand the pressure from the stomach anymore. If this sphincter is too tight or obstructed, it can cause a delay in the stomach emptying as quickly as it should.

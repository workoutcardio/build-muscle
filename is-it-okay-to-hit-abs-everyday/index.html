You need direct ab work daily for results. Technically, yes, you can work out abs every day if you’re trying to build strength and endurance.

<p>Everyday is fine if it's always mild. Your abs are a muscle group, and just like many others, you train that should get a break to recover. Your core muscles work all day to help you walk and move so they don’t always need targeted workouts, but adding in planks, and other balance and stabilization work can be beneficial to overall function.

<p>Instead of trying to build your abs by exercising them daily, moderation is key. Your core muscles work all day to help you walk and move so they don’t always need targeted workouts, but adding in planks, and other balance and stabilization work can be beneficial to overall function.

I train them 3x a week with 3 sets of 20 reps just doing crunches, as you can tell i hate abs but just doing what i do is adequate abdominal training. 3,752 Likes, 160 Comments Alice (clean_eating_alice) on Instagram.</p>

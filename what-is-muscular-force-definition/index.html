<p>Muscular strength is a key component of sport science, and it underpins a wide range of other fitness qualities. Muscular endurance is the ability of a muscle to repeatedly exert force against resistance. Muscle force generation refers to the process in which skeletal muscle, in response to neural stimuli, converts metabolic energy into active force that pulls on the bones through intermediate connective tissue. This also needs a muscular force.</p>

Open circulatory systems are systems where blood, rather than being sealed tight in arteries and veins, suffuses the body and may be directly open to the environment at places such as the digestive tract. It is pumped into a cavity. Many segmented crustaceans have an open circulatory system. (see also color plates.) the circulatory system transports to the tissues and organs of the body the oxygen, nutritive substances, immune.

<p>A circulatory system consists of veins and arteries. Thus building a sophisticated network of blood arteries that reaches every region of the human body. A closed circulatory system is found in vertebrates as well as some of the higher invertebrates. Looking at the issue from the other side, our standard view of a closed circulatory system is based on a system where a multichambered muscular heart pumps blood through parallel systemic and pulmonary circuits simultaneously (figure 1(c)).

If you want to lose fat, yes you can with just 20 minutes a day. You can build muscle and strength in as little as 20 minutes a day if you know what you&#39;re doing. Depends on the workout , and will you be doing it two times a day just twenty minutes in morning and twenty in afternoon? I think the answer to both is yes unless you want to participate in some bodybuilding competition.

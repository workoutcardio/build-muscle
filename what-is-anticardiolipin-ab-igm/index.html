<p>The anticardiolipin blood test is useful in helping to determine if there is a risk for blood clots or help to explain clotting that has happened for some reason. Cardiolipin antibody tests help diagnose the cause of blood clots, recurrent miscarriages or antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, or a kind of fat in the blood that is important for blood clotting. Cardiolipin antibodies are classified as autoantibodies that act against the body’s own cardiolipins. A Case of Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome.</p>

<p>The quantitative measurement of anticardiolipin (acl) antibody is important in diagnosing antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). The test requires a blood sample that is usually taken from a vein in the arm. Anticardiolipin (acl) antibodies measured above 20 cu are considered positive and are associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (aps) as described by international consensus and harris et al [1, 2]. A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested.

Exercise boosts cardiac output and blood pressure in the short term, but people who have adapted to exercise have a lower resting heart rate and less cardiac hypertrophy. Such observations suggest that at least some of the effects on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ascvd) risk factors attributed to exercise training may be the result of recent exercise. 2, reﬂecting the dominant role of cardiac output as a determinant of maximal oxygen consumption. cardiovascular response to acute exercise YouTube.</p>

The body’s response to an exertional stimulus, if performed adequately to meet the imposed demand, is an orchestrated response predominantly among the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and skeletal systems.

<p>Hello, so to begin, there are as we know 3 muscles that construct the muscular system: These muscles are extremely important to help the body perform a variety of crucial tasks, and can be found in many parts of the body. It was also detected in the gastric mucosa and cardiac muscle. The contraction of individual cardiac muscle cells produces force and shortening in these bands of muscle, with a resultant decrease in the heart chamber.</p>

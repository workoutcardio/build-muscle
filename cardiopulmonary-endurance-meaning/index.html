In the above paragraphs we discussed the basic anatomy and working of the cardiopulmonary system. Increasing cardiorespiratory endurance means that you will increase your physical shape, and therefore be able to exercise for longer periods and at a higher intensity level, without getting tired. Your body can keep exercising for a long time without stopping. (moderate to vigorous physical activity) typically means that an individual is sweating, with an increased heart rate.

In the above paragraphs we discussed the basic anatomy and working of the cardiopulmonary system. Increasing cardiorespiratory endurance means that you will increase your physical shape, and therefore be able to exercise for longer periods and at a higher intensity level, without getting tired. Your body can keep exercising for a long time without stopping. (moderate to vigorous physical activity) typically means that an individual is sweating, with an increased heart rate.

<p>Cardiopulmonary exercise (cpx) testing is a provocative test that combines standard methods of electrocardiogram (ecg) stress testing with indices of gas exchange. Cardiorespiratory endurance is essential to sustain slow movements, and for dancers, slow movement sequences also involve a wide range of motion. “cardiorespiratory endurance is the ability of your heart, blood vessels, and lungs to deliver oxygen to working muscles,” says trevor thieme, c.s.c.s., beachbody’s senior manager of fitness and nutrition content.

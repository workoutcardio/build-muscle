How open vascular bundles differ from closed vascular class 11 biology CBSE From vedantu.com
In a vascular bundle, the xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves and phloem transports food from leaves to all parts of the plant. The closed vascular bundles are generally found in monocotyledons. In higher plants, vascular bundles are present inside the stele. They do not show secondary growth.

<p>Open vascular bundles are the vascular bundles which comprises of cambium possess the ability to form secondary xylem and phloem. These are specialized tissues that run through the plant and carry water and nutrition to different parts of the plants. It is a strand of conducting vessels in the stem or leaves of a plant typically with phloem on the outside and xylem on the inside. Vascular bundles are classified based on different criterion a) depending upon the presence or absence of cambrium they may be open or closed.

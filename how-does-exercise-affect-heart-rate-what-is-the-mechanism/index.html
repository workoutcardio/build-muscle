<p>Sweating draws water from the blood and, over time, leaves less blood flowing through your heart and to your muscles, reducing oxygen supply to the muscles. At rest, our nervous system maintains a parasympathetic tone, which affects the respiratory rate, cardiac output, and various metabolic processes. Exercise is a big variable when it comes to heart rate. Because most of the factors concerned with acceleration, are operating during exercise.</p>

Gym in Belleville, ON 199 Bell Blvd Fitness From planetfitness.ca
“judgement free zone” is the motto of each gym. When i first started going to the gym, i was overwhelmed of all of the weights and the people. Planet fitness may be a great gym that gives the skills and tools expected to obtain workouts for some people. The gym is designed for people who want to lose weight or get in shape, not for people who want to build muscle.

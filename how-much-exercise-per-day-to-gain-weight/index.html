How many days should i work out a week is easy to answer when you&#39;re a beginner. If you choose the upper/lower split routine, you&#39;ll be exercising each muscle group two times per week. If you want to neither lose nor gain any weight, you should be eating calories per day. At this rate, you would have gained 1 kg by the end of 1 or 2 weeks, depending on your intake.

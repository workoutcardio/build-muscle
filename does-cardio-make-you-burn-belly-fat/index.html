More cardio is not necessarily better. Doing cardio when insulin is low (when fasting) should allow more fat to be burned. Although any typical physical activity contributes to your calorie burn for weight loss, some types of cardio are better than others for burning belly fat. Doing regular cardio exercise is a good way to burn overall body fat, including belly fat.

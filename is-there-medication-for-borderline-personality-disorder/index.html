Borderline Personality Disorder Medications Cadabams From cadabams.org
Borderline personality disorder is mainly treated using psychotherapy, but medication may be added. Even when drugs have shown some benefit, there are many core symptoms of bpd that they do not address. Overall, there’s not a lot of research evidence when it comes to medication use in bpd. However, where there is evidence of aggression and impulsivity, and schizotypal and paranoid features within the personality disturbance, antipsychotic drugs, both typical and atypical, may play a role in the treatment of personality disorders.

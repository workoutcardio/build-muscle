<p>Each miscarriage was found to increase a woman’s risk of heart disease by 6% while giving birth to a stillborn child was associated with a 22% higher risk of heart disease and a 44% higher risk of stroke. Heart rate variability (hrv) can be analyzed using electrocardiography (ecg) to assess the activity of the autonomic nervous system (kimura et al., 1996). Your body releases adrenaline, a hormone that temporarily causes your breathing and heart rate to speed up and your blood pressure to rise.

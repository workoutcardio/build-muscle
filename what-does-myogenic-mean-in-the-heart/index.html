The human heart is termed myogenic. When used to describe the heart does it mean that the heart contracts without having a message from the brain.as the pace maker does it. Originating in muscle, as an impulse or sensation. The myogenic heart is the intrinsic property of the cardiac muscles.

<p>Since the heartbeat is initiated by the sa node and the impulse of contraction originates in the heart itself, the human heart is termed as myogenic. This intrinsic rhythm means the heart beats at around 60 times per minute; In the human heart, contraction is initiated by a special modified heart muscle known as sinoatrial node.

<p>This is because heart muscle cells continuously depolarise without any external stimulus. Myogenic is the term used for muscles or tissues that can contract on their own, without any external electrical stimulus, from the brain or spinal cord for example. The sa node has the inherent power of generating a wave of contraction and controlling the heartbeat. Myogenic means that a muscle is able to contract with no external stimulus.

<p>The right atrium (auricle) receives deoxygenated blood and the left atrium receives oxygenated blood, which they pour into the ventricles. The myogenic heart is the characteristics of vertebrates where continuous rhythmic contraction occurs. Another example is the human heart.

<p>The sinoatrial node (san) is a group of cells in the wall of the right atrium. The myogenic heart is the intrinsic property of the cardiac muscles. The contractions of cardiac muscle fibres are described as myogenic, since they are produced spontaneously, without requiring stimulation from nerve cells (see pacemaker). The rationale is that the impulse to beat comes. Effect of EGFand AT 1 receptor blockade on increased myogenic.</p>

The myogenic heart is the intrinsic property of the cardiac muscles. Take the heart for example, if you take cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) out of the body and keep them alive in a suitable medium, they will continue to contract.

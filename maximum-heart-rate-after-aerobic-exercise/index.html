<p>The following are the five different zones based on your maximum heart rate: For example, if you’re 45 years old, subtract 45 from 220 to get a maximum heart rate of 175. For moderate physical activity, the goal is usually 50 to 70 percent, while vigorous physical activity often reaches 70 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. If you’ve completed a session of low to moderate aerobic exercise intensity, your heart rate will usually get back to normal between 10 to 20 minutes after exercise.</p>

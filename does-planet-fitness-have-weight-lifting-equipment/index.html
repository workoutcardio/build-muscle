If you are fairly light weight, a beginner, or a woman, the weights you can find there will be heavy enough to let you get in a decent workout. However, it is essential to note that they don’t have a power rack. Using either free weights or weight machines can improve the body’s fitness and health as long as you use them properly. However if you were training regularly at the same gym it wouldn&#39;t matter what the weights were as long as they are all the same.

It has secondary fuel sources, and one of those is fat, but you can’t metabolize fat fast enough so relatively little of your cardio effort is actually going. The same way, if your body burns 2000 calories a day and you are consuming 3000, it is literally impossible for it to lose fat since you are still giving it 1000 extra calories.

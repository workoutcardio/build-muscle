A tube is inserted into one of the blood vessels that carry blood into the heart. A cardiologist is skilled in diagnosing and treating any type of heart disease as well as cardiovascular conditions. The perfusionist provides the surgeon the means to operate on a still, unbeating heart. This test may be done during rest and while you exercise.

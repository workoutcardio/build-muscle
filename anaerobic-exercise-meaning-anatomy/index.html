Is Anaerobic Exercise Better For Some People? From fitstep.com
Sprinting is a fantastic way to burn fat by exerting energy in bursts. A study in the journal of applied physiology verified those sentiments, and mentioned that aerobics are optimal for reducing fat mass and body mass over resistance training. Each energy system is used in differing amounts. The use of aerobic and anaerobic exercise in practical examples of differing intensities link practical examples of sporting situations to aerobic or anaerobic exercise.

<p>The use of aerobic and anaerobic exercise in practical examples of differing intensities link practical examples of sporting situations to aerobic or anaerobic exercise. In strenuous exercise the amount of stored glycogen in the muscle may be a critical factor. In strenuous, short term anaerobic exercise, the glycogen store in a muscle lasts only some 20 s, and this terminates the activity. This means that unlike aerobic exercise where energy is produced from oxygen, anaerobic uses energy from muscle. Aerobic and anaerobic training Body energy systems, Energy system.</p>

Fitness in this evolutionary sense has three important features: It is relative to competitors in a species, it is relative to an environment, and it is a statistical. Biological or ” darwinian ” fitness is being able to live long enough. What does evolutionary darwinian fitness measure?

The term ” fitness ” in evolutionary biology means the ability of an organism to pass on its genetic material to its offspring.

<p>This is yet another concern of most people. Your anaerobic zone is somewhere between 80 percent and 90 percent of your mhr. Although the immediate recovery of heart rate (fast phase) following aerobic exercise is due solely to parasympathetic reactivation, the slow phase of recovery is thought to be due to withdrawal of sympathetic outflow lasting upward of 90 min after exercise (61, 75).

One must be able to maintain this heart rate. Low intensity cardio may not burn quite as many calories as high intensity cardio does, but it is still effective nonetheless and has its own unique advantages that high intensity cardio does not offer. It is primarily used as a way to increase long term endurance, so athletes can take part in marathons or other very lengthy competitions. Weight loss trends come and go, from fad diets to &#39;squat challenges&#39; and other supposed quick fixes that are touted to help you lose weight fast.

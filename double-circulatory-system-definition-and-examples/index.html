<p>In single circulation, blood flows to and from the heart through a single pathway, whereas in double circulation there are two separate pathways that are. The human circulatory system is a double circulatory system. Double circulation is a pathway followed by blood in which it travels throughout the different organs of the body through the veins and arteries.

<p>The pulmonary circulation is a circuit loop from the right heart taking deoxygenated blood to the lungs where it. A type of circulation in which blood flows through the heart twice is called double circulation. One is oxygenated, meaning oxygen rich, and the other is deoxygenated, which means it has little to no oxygen, but a lot of carbon dioxide.

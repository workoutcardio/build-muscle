<p>Calculate the difference in wrist pulse and blood pressure before and after the deep breathing exercise. Make a pumping model of a heart, or try one of our sports science investigations. Exercise is a big variable when it comes to heart rate. An independent variable is one that <em>you</em> manipulate to see what the effect is.

<p>The aha recommends a person gets at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise—exercise that elevates their heart rate to the target heart rate zone—on most days of the week, or a total. Students work in groups to develop a hypothesis about how exercise. A drop in blood volume causes the heart to beat harder and faster to move the blood through the bloodstream. This activity was designed for anatomy and physiology students who are studying how feedback loops work and also serves as a refresher on the scientific method and designing experiments (science and engineering practices). do different types of music affect heart rate?

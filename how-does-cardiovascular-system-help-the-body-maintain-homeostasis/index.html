The respiratory system helps maintain homeostasis by regulating the intake of air into the body and by removing carbon dioxide from the blood, which in turn assists the circulatory system’s function and many other operations in the body.

Did you know the circulatory system comprises the heart, veins, capillaries. Thus the healthy heart can pump more blood when there is more blood to pump. In 90 degree weather, it is thanks to our integumentary and cardiovascular systems that we may take a brief reprieve. Homeostasis is maintained by the respiratory system in two ways:

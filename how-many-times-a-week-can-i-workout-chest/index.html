Spartacus mens health workout by Alex Morais Issuu From issuu.com
Hi richard, the question you asked can have multiple answers, depending on your goals, but assuming that you are one of those who goes to gym for just being fit, i will answer this. This is accomplished by combining chest workouts. If you find out you are performing more than 20 sets per week, there is a very good chance you are doing too much and are actually diminishing your bodies ability to build new muscle mass. You need to be hitting the weights at least three days per week.

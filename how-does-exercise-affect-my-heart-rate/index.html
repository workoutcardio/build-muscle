<p>How does exercise affect resting pulse rate? When you exercise, including running, your heart rate will increase, meaning that your pulse will become faster because your body is under physical stress. A single exercise session may protect the cardiovascular system for two to three hours, the authors postulate. When under stress, your heart must pump more blood containing oxygen and nutrients throughout your body, which is why your pulse increases.</p>

<p>The american heart association, for example, says your target heart rate during moderate intensity activities should be about 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate, while during vigorous physical activity you should aim for roughly 70% to 85% of your max. The blood volume and blood flow returning to your heart increases. More oxygen is also going to the muscles. Fortunately, regular exercise is good at training.

<p>Cardiovascular exercise increases the number of new blood vessels while resistance training increases the size of those blood vessels. As you exercise more strenuously, the sympathetic system âkicks inâ to accelerate your heart rate even more. This demand will cause sympathetic nerves to stimulate the heart to beat faster and with more force to increase overall blood flow. The sympathetic nerves will also stimulate the veins, causing them to compress. How exercise affects our bodies (heart rate and short term memory.</p>

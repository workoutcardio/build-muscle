<p>How does exercise affect resting pulse rate? When you exercise, including running, your heart rate will increase, meaning that your pulse will become faster because your body is under physical stress. A single exercise session may protect the cardiovascular system for two to three hours, the authors postulate. When under stress, your heart must pump more blood containing oxygen and nutrients throughout your body, which is why your pulse increases.</p>

The best heart rate zone for aerobic exercise is between 50 percent and 75 percent of your maximum heart rate. Measuring your heart rate by taking your pulse take your pulse before you warm up.

So, say you start off being able to run 10km in 45mins with an average heart rate of 150 beats per minute (bpm), after a period of regular training you might be able to run the same distance in the same time with an average heart rate of 140bpm.

<p>The american heart association, for example, says your target heart rate during moderate intensity activities should be about 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate, while during vigorous physical activity you should aim for roughly 70% to 85% of your max. The blood volume and blood flow returning to your heart increases. More oxygen is also going to the muscles. Fortunately, regular exercise is good at training.

<p>At the beginning of exercise, your body removes the parasympathetic stimulation, which enables the heart rate to gradually increase. Your resting pulse naturally increases as you get older, but your maximum heart rate decreases.

<p>Exercise also stimulates the production of new blood vessels. At the beginning of exercise, your body removes the parasympathetic stimulation, which enables the heart rate to gradually increase. Although this can resolve on its own, merck manuals recommends seeking medical attention for an episode that lasts longer than 20 minutes.

<p>Cardiovascular exercise increases the number of new blood vessels while resistance training increases the size of those blood vessels. As you exercise more strenuously, the sympathetic system “kicks in” to accelerate your heart rate even more. This demand will cause sympathetic nerves to stimulate the heart to beat faster and with more force to increase overall blood flow. The sympathetic nerves will also stimulate the veins, causing them to compress. How exercise affects our bodies (heart rate and short term memory.</p>

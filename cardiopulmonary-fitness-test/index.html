What is Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing? Love Medical From lovemedical.com
The information gathered during a cpet is used to calculate peak vo2 (the highest level of oxygen consumption attained at peak exercise). The co 2 analyzer should read a room air fraction of 0.03±0.02% and should not change when the 100% n 2 or 16% o 2 fractions are sampled from the calibration tanks. What happens at a cpet appointment? Peak vo2 is the best measure of cardio respiratory fitness, also known as functional capacity or exercise capacity.

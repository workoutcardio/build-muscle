When you hit the weights, train for strength and power. Keeping your abs and glutes engaged, curl the weight toward your chest, rotating your palm toward you, then press it overhead, rotating your palm away from you. You cannot train as hard when running if you do weights alot through, i play football aswell which helps my running, but i only run a maximum off twice a week doing about 8 minute miles just taking it a bit easier, then one hard run trying to hit better times each week, i run many hills in my training course which also help. Strength training can also help you overcome the muscle imbalances and weaknesses that come from running alone.

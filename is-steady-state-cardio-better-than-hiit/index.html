<p>Not only do you improve your oxygen consumption with hiit, but you can also do it within half the time of traditional forms of endurance training. While hiit seems to be better than steady state for preserving muscle mass, the difference is often marginal and dependent on other factors such as diet and training protocol. Therefore, the team compared which method is best to maintain muscle mass. Sprinting, rowing, or bodyweight movement like burpees or box.

<p>During hiit, you are working the more powerful, more strength oriented type 2 muscle fibers which are more likely to hypertrophy (grow). So it is all well and good saying âhiit is better than steady state cardio for fat lossâ, but that depends on the intensity and the time exercised for. Try low to moderately intense workouts to help increase blood flow to damaged muscle tissues and boost your recovery. Even though the percentage of the calories you burn during hiit that come from fat is low, you will still end up burning more fat during your workout than a steady state cardio session of the same duration.

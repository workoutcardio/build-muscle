Respiration is the process in which organisms exchange gases between their body cells and the environment. Just like our digestive system breaks down the food we eat, cells must break down glucose to use it. The metabolic process in living organisms by which oxygen is combined with carbon in a cell to form carbon dioxide and generate energy. Cellular respiration is a series of chemical reactions that break down glucose to produce atp, which may be used as energy to power many reactions throughout the body.

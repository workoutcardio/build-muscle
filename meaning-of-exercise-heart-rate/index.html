<p>For example, if your maximum heart rate is 170, your target heart rate should range from 85 beats per minute to 145 beats per minute during periods of exercise. Therefore, each time your heart contracts, more blood is pumped to your muscles. This is why tracking heart rate is so important. This process is measured by a term called “cardiac output,” which determines the amount of blood pumped by the heart in a given minute.</p>

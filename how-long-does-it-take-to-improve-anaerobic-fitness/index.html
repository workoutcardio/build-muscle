Top 5 effective exercises for height growth. Increase your height by 3 From hubpages.com
How the body uses stored energy. You may not improve your maximum speed or anaerobic power specifically, but your overall anaerobic fitness will improve, as long as you training intensity is high enough. Your body’s ability to transport and utilise oxygen is one of the first things you’ll notice after a prolonged period of inactivity. Endurance training such as running and biking will help, as will interval training, such as sprint workouts.

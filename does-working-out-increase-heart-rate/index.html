Heart Rate When Exercising From slideshare.net
To calculate your heart rate on the high end of the suitable range , multiply 170 by 0.75 to get about 128 beats per minute. When working out for muscular endurance and anaerobic fitness, your heart rate will increase incrementally throughout the workout. At an 85 percent level of exertion, your target would be 145 beats per minute. Improves the muscles’ ability to pull oxygen out of the blood, reducing the need for the heart to pump more blood to the muscles.

<p>Even if you’re younger, try to never go over the maximum heart rate limit, as you can experience a high heart rate when working out, especially during some vigorous physical activity, which can lead to some serious health problems. It’s vital to avoid intense exercise on scorching and humid days for this reason, especially if you have any heart conditions or are new to intense exercise. To figure out this range, follow the same formula used above, except change 64 and 76% to 77 and 93%. Works like a beta blocker to slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure.</p>

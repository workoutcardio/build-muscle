Cardio before or after your workout? Fit Body By Best From fitbodybygeorge.com
Doing cardio after weights means running, rowing, cycling, or stepping with fat as your primary energy source. But if your goal is to see big increases in your strength training or overall endurance, you&#39;ll be disappointed. The focus is to run shorter and faster runs in the week and a long slower run at a comfortable pace on the weekend. If you’re already tired after a cardio session, that can affect your form and increase the risk of injury.

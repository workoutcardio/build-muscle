In designing a split that focuses on arms, it’s critical not to hit the pulling muscles (back, biceps) and the pushing muscles (chest, shoulders, triceps) on consecutive days. Clench your fists and hold them around chin height in front of you, facing your body. While seated, rest your wrist on your knees or a flat surface with your palms facing down. Perform a triceps extension by extending your elbow until your arm is straight.

How highintensity interval training keeps you young Arena District From arenaathletic.com
National physical activity guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of high intensity aerobic activity every week. Once up to about 10 percent of the total weekly volume in z3, you should consider replacing some of the z3 with z4. Aerobic exercise provides a wide range of benefits for the body and brain. The main goal of this study was to investigate the acute metabolic and cardiorespiratory response to long and short hiie compared to continuous exercise (ce) as well as its regulation and predictability.

Aerobic exercise provides a wide range of benefits for the body and brain. Aerobic is defined as relating to, involving, or requiring oxygen,  and refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism adequately.

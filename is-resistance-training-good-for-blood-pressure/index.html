Resistance training has been less well studied. A study published in the journal of the american college of cardiology in 2006 showed that weight training causes cells lining the arteries of the heart to function in an irregular fashion in people who are just starting. The authors concluded that resistance training by itself is effective in reducing blood pressure among hypertensive individuals. Abstract—we reviewed the effect of resistance training on blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in adults.

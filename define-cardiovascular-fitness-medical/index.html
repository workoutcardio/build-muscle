Definition Of Cardiovascular Fitness Health definitoin From definitoin.blogspot.com
Cardiovascular fitness can be defined simply as your body&#39;s ability to get oxygen and blood to the muscles. The ability of a person to transport oxygen to working muscles is influenced by a variety of physiological characteristics, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and maximum oxygen. Cardiovascular endurance is the ability of the heart, lungs and blood vessels to deliver oxygen to working muscles and tissues, as well as the ability of those muscles and tissues to utilize that oxygen. Cardiovascular fitness refers to the capacity of your heart to deliver oxygen to your muscles, as well as the ability of your muscles to utilize oxygen for sustained periods of physical activity.

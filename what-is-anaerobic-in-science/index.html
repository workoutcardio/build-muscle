<p>Anaerobic literally means “without air,” so anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel the muscles. Anaerobic respiration is less efficient than aerobic respiration, but it can still provide cells with the energy they need to. Anaerobic respiration releases less energy than aerobic respiration but it does this more quickly. Anaerobic bacteria are fastidious, difficult to isolate, and often overlooked. aerobic and anaerobic word equation Google Search Words, Science.</p>

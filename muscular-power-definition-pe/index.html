PE Lessons for Muscular Strength From livestrong.com
The notion of muscle power refers to the force that you can apply a person with a movement and the speed with which this particular application. While strength is the maximal force you can apply against a load, power is proportional to the speed at which you can apply this maximal force. Training to improve power can include lifting weights.

<p>Muscular strength is increased by performing progressive resistance training over time to improve the endurance of the muscle. It is, therefore, the ability of a person to exert force quickly. Muscular strength relies heavily on your type ii (fast twitch) muscle fibres, and if you’re really interested in the underpinning. A good practical example of muscular strength would be your 1 repetition maximum squat or bench press, whereas an example of muscular endurance might be a 20 rep squat or a plank hold for as long as you can hold it with correct technique.

<p>The meaning of coronary heart disease is a condition and especially one caused by atherosclerosis that reduces blood flow through the coronary arteries to the heart and typically results in chest pain or heart damage. The coronary arteries branch from the base of the aorta and encircle the heart in the coronary sulcus (atrioventricular groove) at the junction of the atria and ventricles, and these arteries are compressed when the ventricles are contracting and fill when the heart is relaxed. First, take care of the obvious factors like high blood pressure, smoking and high cholesterol. Plaque buildup causes the inside of the arteries to narrow over time.

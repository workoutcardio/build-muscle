<p>Maximal force that a muscle or muscle group can generate ex: Muscular strength is the ability to exert maximal force in one single contraction, such as lifting a weight that you could lift only once before needing a short break. Normally tested muscles are shoulder abductors, elbow flexors, elbow extensors, wrist extensors, finger flexors, hand intrinsics, hip flexors, knee extensors, dorsiflexors, and plantar flexors. These types of contractions are often called âexplosiveâ.</p>

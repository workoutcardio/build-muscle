Overview of Cellular Respiration Aerobic &amp; Anaerobic Respiration From byjus.com
Due to absence of light, the process of photosynthesis stops at night, but aerobic. Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. This type of cellular respiration is seen in aerobes and facultative anaerobes. During aerobic respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen to form water and carbon dioxide.

<p>During aerobic respiration, glucose is broken down in the presence of oxygen to form water and carbon dioxide. Aerobic respiration is one of the two types of cellular respiration defined as a metabolic process involving the conversion of chemical substances from food into energy through the use of oxygen. Anaerobic means without oxygen or in the absence of oxygen, while aerobic means with oxygen or in the presence of oxygen. Types of respiration aerobic respiration.</p>

<p>This type of cellular respiration is seen in aerobes and facultative anaerobes. Anaerobic respirationtakes place without any molecular oxygen. Partial oxidation of food in the absence of oxygen, resulting in the release of some amount of energy, is called anaerobic respiration. Carbon dioxide and water are produced as waste products as well as releasing useful cellular energy. PPT Aerobic Cellular Respiration PowerPoint Presentation, free.</p>

<p>The chemical equation for aerobic respiration is glucose + oxygen gives carbon dioxide + water + energy whereas. Glycolysis forms the first step of aerobic respiration in which glucose is broken down anaerobically to form two molecules of pyruvic acid. It is a 10 step process which takes place in the cytoplasm of cells. Both processes begin with the breakdown of sugar (glucose) both processes involve pyruvate.

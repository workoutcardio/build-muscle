Reduces stress hormones that can put an extra burden on the heart. The american heart association notes that if you are calm, relaxed, not ill and are sitting or lying down, your resting heart rate is typically between 60 beats per minute and 100 bpm. More oxygen is also going to the muscles. While exercising, the heart rate can be checked with a heart rate monitoring device or by examining your pulse.

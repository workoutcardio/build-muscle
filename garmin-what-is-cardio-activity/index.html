Garmin Vivosmart HR&#43; GPS Activity Tracker?SportsFitness Acc?Smart From sustuu.com
The type of activities i would like to include would be stationary cycle, rowing ergometer, elliptical trainer, treadmill and so on. The only way i can get garmin to count cardio is to start a separate cardio activity and do whatever else as cardio (yoga, pilates, circuit routine) instead of as its actual activity in garmin. I have a fr245 but have been using cardio. You can turn on gps and use the cardio profile for an outdoor activity.

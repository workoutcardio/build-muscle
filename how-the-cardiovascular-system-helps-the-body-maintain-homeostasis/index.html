The lungs accomplish gas exchange by removing carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration. We have discussed mechanisms within the heart that regulate cardiac output. The mechanisms within the circulatory system ensure that every cell maintains a constant internal environment. Thus the healthy heart can pump more blood when there is more blood to pump.

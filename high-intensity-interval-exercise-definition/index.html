Most prevalent predictive factor for developing cardiovascular disease: Hiit, by definition, utilizes planned intensity and work to rest/recovery ratios in unlimited variations (see laursen and buchheit, 2019, figure 1 for detail on intensity and design variability). For instance, if your exercise is walking and you&#39;re in good shape, you might add short bursts of jogging into your regular brisk walks. Repeat steps 2 and 3 three times, for a total of 4 cycles.

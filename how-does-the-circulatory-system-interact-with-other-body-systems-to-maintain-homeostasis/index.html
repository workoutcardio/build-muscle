Body systems and homeostasis From slideshare.net
To maintain homeostasis, the respiratory and circulatory systems collaborate. After much consideration and time to process all of the organ systems in the human body, i feel as if the circulatory system is a significant key element in maintaining homeostasis in the human body. The integumentary system serves all other systems by providing a physical barrier to environmental hazards. Homeostasis is balance within the body and each of the body systems contribute to maintaining this balance by contributing interactions with their component systems to regulate the functioning of each body system.

CONTINUOUS TRAINING From studylib.net
Continuous training is a form of exercise that is performed at a &#39;continuous&#39; intensity throughout and doesn’t involve any rest periods. This is commonly used to train the anaerobic energy system. The intensity of the work is just below the point at which an oxygen debt would develop. It involves working for a prolonged period of time at a steady stress level.

Humans have survived on this planet for thousands of years because of our ability to adapt. During physical exercise, requirements for oxygen and substrate in skeletal muscle are increased, as are the removal of metabolites and carbon dioxide. It is often directed toward also the honing of athletic ability or skill. Exercise physiology (even if this is the name of the degree) exercise science (same as above) chemistry;

<p>The second important physiological change experienced by the cardiovascular system due to exercise is the reduction of blood pressure. Exercise physiologists, for example, study how our bodies obtain energy from the food we eat and use the energy to initiate and sustain muscle activity. Scholastica (css) is built upon a foundation of ethical principles and professionalism. Exercise physiology research has found fat as the major energy source during rest and light exercise and carbohydrates (cho) increasingly becomes the primary source as exercise intensity increases.

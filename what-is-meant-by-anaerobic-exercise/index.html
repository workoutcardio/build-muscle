Anaerobic Exercise, Definition, Purpose, Demographics, Description From reference.jrank.org
Anaerobic exercise is significant use of muscles in a way that quickly burns oxygen. Aerobic exercise is good for improving your cardiovascular endurance, while anaerobic exercises are ideal for building muscle strength. Anaerobic exercises push your body and lungs to rely on energy sources stored in the muscles. The increased exercise activity increases the amount of carbon dioxide and lactic acid in the muscles.

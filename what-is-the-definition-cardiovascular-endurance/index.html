PPT Chapter 3 Increasing Cardiorespiratory Endurance PowerPoint From slideserve.com
Cardiovascular endurance is the ability to exercise without becoming overly tired. In other words, it can be said that it is the physical ability to maintain aerobic exercise for prolonged period of time. This is because cardiovascular activities mainly rely on carbohydrates to provide the energy needed, so consuming the proper amount can be beneficial. The more efficiently our body deliver oxygen to its tissue the lower your breathing rate is.

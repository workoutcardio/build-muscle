<p>Anaerobic metabolism is a natural part of metabolic energy expenditure. Fast twitch muscles (as compared to slow twitch muscles) operate using anaerobic metabolic systems, such that any use of fast twitch muscle fibers leads to an increased anaerobic energy expenditure. The word “aerobic” means “with oxygen,” as this kind of exercise is fueled by the oxygen that. The body uses this oxygen to break down energy sources like fats and glucose to release energy we can use to perform the exercise. Differences Between Aerobic and Anaerobic Benefits and Risks.</p>

Weight Loss Exercises At Home Reddit BMI Formula From bmiformulame.blogspot.com
Cardio is more effective than weight training at decreasing body fat if you do more than 150 minutes per week. Even better, you could just do a quick cardio warm up, then have 1 or 2 days dedicated strictly to cardio, like taking a zumba class or something. Of these, running is the best for fat loss as you have to support your whole body and you can’t take a break like you can on a bike. Cardio or weights for fat loss is the wrong question.

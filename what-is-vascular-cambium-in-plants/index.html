Through mutant analysis and imaging, the. As mentioned earlier, primary growth is the effort of the apical meristem. It is difficult to overemphasize the importance of the vascular cambium which produces secondary xylem and secondary phloem. The cambium located between xylem and phloem is called intrafascicular cambium.

It is difficult to overemphasize the importance of the vascular cambium which produces secondary xylem and secondary phloem. Cambium, plural cambiums, orcambia, in plants, layer of actively dividing cells between xylem (wood) and phloem (bast) tissues that is responsible for the secondary growth of stems and roots (secondary growth occurs after the first season and results in increase in thickness). The cambium is filled with undifferentiated cells which have the ability to differentiate into many different types. Cambium of the root is the example of a Apical meristem class 11.</p>

It would be too easy to see rend your heart as more of a give your heart to the lord. I tell them it&#39;s not permission for them to do as they like, but they insist god cares more about the heart than what. Real repentance means changing your heart, and a complete change of heart requires more than a partial surrender. Pay too dearly for (one&#39;s) whistle.

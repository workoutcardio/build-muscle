The Ultimate ScienceBased Resistance Training Routine for Older Adults From hituni.com
Pubmed, web of science, and scopus databases were searched from inception until 30 april, 2018. Training can be time efficient and effective for health benefits: Randomized, controlled trials lasting ≥4 weeks investigating the effects of resistance. We reviewed the effect of resistance training on blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in adults.

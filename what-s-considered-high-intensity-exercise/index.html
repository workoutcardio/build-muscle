These two numbers are your average target heart rate zone for vigorous exercise intensity when using the hrr to calculate your heart rate. If you only work at less than 80% of your training max, then you are not training in the high intensity “zone.”. Your heart rate during vigorous exercise should generally be between these two numbers. Multiply your hrr by 0.85 (85%).

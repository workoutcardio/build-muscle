<p>Advantages of continuous training continuous training does not usually call for heavy equipment, meaning that is easier for athletes and trainees to perform required tasks. Long story short, employee training is continuous, and companies need it. Machine learning models are built on the assumption that the data the model was trained on will be identical to the data used when making predictions. So an athlete may work for 20 seconds at 90% intensity, then rest for 1 minute.</p>

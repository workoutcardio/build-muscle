<p>Basically, it’s how well your heart and lungs can work together to pump blood, oxygen, and nutrients to exercising. Cardiorespiratory refers to the combined effort of the heart and lungs to aerobically supply oxygen to muscles throughout the body in order to execute and maintain healthy activity. In 2016, the american heart association  published an official scientific statement advocating that crf be categorized as a clinical vital sign and should be routinely assessed as part of clinical practice. Optimizing crf prior to surgical interventions may improve outcomes, including surgical risk, mortality and the ability to function after surgery.</p>

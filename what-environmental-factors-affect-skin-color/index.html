<p>The way your skin reacts to these pollutants is as varied. Something as simple as taking a very hot bath, using harsh soap or air temperature changes can affect blood flow to the skin which in turn impacts delivery of toxins to the skin’s surface and elimination of substances through sweat. While we can’t always control the environment, there are steps that we can take to ensure that our skin stays healthy despite all that works against it. The origin of skin color has been significantly a discussion of importance among human biology scientists, anthropologists and others interested in evolution of human skin color.

<p>In darker skin tones, a higher melanin content protects the skin from sun damage and causes it to tan. Skin is prone to dehydration when exposed to dry, windy, wintery weather outdoors, which may be aggravated further by central heating inside. One way to determine if your home is affecting your skin is to hire. Ultraviolet light from the sun is the poisonous sun rays from the sun which arises due to failure of atmosphere to protecting it from reaching the earth surface, the rays destroy the melanin a substant that is associated with skin color.this type of raise is very dangerous for ling thing,this can totaly affect the environment causing alot damage to the earth.human beings.

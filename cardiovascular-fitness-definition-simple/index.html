<p>In simple words, crf estimates how much the body requires taking in oxygen and transfers to the muscles and organs, throughout the intense exercises. As noted above, the cardiovascular fitness hypothesis suggests that cardiovascular (i.e., “aerobic”) fitness is the physiological mediator that explains the relationship between physical exercise and improved cognitive performance. Cardiovascular exercise is movement that requires the delivery of oxygen to the muscles. A vo2 max test is considered the most reliable and valid measurement of cardiorespiratory fitness.

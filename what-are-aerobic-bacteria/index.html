<p>Aerobic bacteria are defined as bacteria that grow in the presence of oxygen whereas anaerobic bacteria are defined as bacteria that can grow in the absence of oxygen. When we say bacteria are aerobic, it means that these bacteria can only grow or survive in the presence of oxygen. In a process known as cellular respiration, these organisms use oxygen to oxidize substrates (for example sugars and fats) and generate energy.

<p>When we say bacteria are aerobic, it means that these bacteria can only grow or survive in the presence of oxygen. Although some aerobic organisms, such as animals, breathe in oxygen through lungs or gills, other organisms, like plants, fungi, and bacteria, are also aerobic. In order to understand how aerobic bacteria work within wastewater treatment, we first need to dive into what bacteria are and how they work both in the body and in residential wastewater treatment. These bacterias are very useful and take part in various biogeochemical cycles of the environment and help in maintaining the balance and equilibrium between different elements of.

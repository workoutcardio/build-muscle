Harvard step test is a cardiovascular fitness test.it is also called aerobic fitness test.it was developed by brouha and others in 1943.it is used to measure the cardiovascular fitness by checking the recovery rate. Cardiac output is the amount of blood that the heart pumps into the aorta each minute and in a healthy individual it is matched by the body’s total metabolic need. Stroke volume (sv) is volume of blood pumped out per ventricle per beat, which is normally about 70 ml. Changes in cardiac output over months or years could indicate a change in the heart&#39;s ability to pump blood.

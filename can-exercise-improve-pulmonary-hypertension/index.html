Macitentan Significantly Reduces PAHRelated Hospitalization, Study Shows From pulmonaryhypertensionnews.com
1 pulmonary hypertension may complicate multiple clinical disorders and invariably it reduces exercise and functional capacity and represents a risk factor for morbidity and mortality. The best data supporting the benefits of exercise in pulmonary hypertension was published in 2006 (merles et al, circulation 2006). Exercise pulmonary hypertension (ph) can be defined as a pulmonary artery pressure (pap) / cardiac output (co) slope of &gt;3 mmhg/l/min.1,2 indexing of pap to co is preferred to a single absolute cutoff point for exercise pap to account for variable increases in flow with exercise. This restriction is caused by a massively increased afterload of the right.

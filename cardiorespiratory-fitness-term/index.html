To elucidate whether cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) is protective or contributory to coronary artery disease plaque burden. Cardiorespiratory fitness is the overall capacity to perform exertion exercise. Determination of cardiorespiratory fitness in terms of maximum oxygen uptake (vo 2 max) is restricted to within the laboratory because of its exhausting and difficult experimental. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) refers to the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity.

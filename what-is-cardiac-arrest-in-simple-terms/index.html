<p>Other risk factors for cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest, also known as sudden cardiac arrest, is when the heart stops beating suddenly. Cardiac arrest is often fatal if appropriate steps aren’t taken immediately. The loss of blood flow damages the heart muscle, but the heart usually keeps beating.

<p>Cardiac arrest occurs when the electrical signals that control the heart’s movements malfunction, causing the heart to stop beating. This condition happens because of a problem in the electrical system of the heart. The idea is to maintain the flow of oxygen to the body’s tissues until the heart can be “resuscitated.” this is a problem, however, since 80% of cardiac arrests happen outside of hospitals or health centers. In fact, in spain, for example, only 6 out of every 100 people know what to do when faced with that situation, despite the country’s renowned healthcare system.

<p>When you exercise at the highest possible intensity, your heart will reach maximal heart rate (hrmax), the fastest rate it is capable of. Exercising above 85% of your target heart rate could bring you sore joints and muscles. Exercising regularly at a target heart rate ensures that there is minimum undue stress on the heart and maximum benefit from the exercises. One commonly used equation for finding max heart rate is to subtract your age from 220. Heart Rate Chart Productive Fitness.</p>

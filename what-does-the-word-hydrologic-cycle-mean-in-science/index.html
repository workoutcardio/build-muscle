<p>Evaporation is the primary pathway that water moves from the liquid state back into the water cycle as atmospheric water vapour. Before launching into the individual water quality parameters and interactions, some discussion is needed to put the earth’s water systems or hydrologic cycle into perspective. The hydrologic cycle consists primarily of the evaporation of the water, the carrying of the water vapor over distance, its condensation and the precipitation of clouds, the seepage of. The water cycle — technically known as the hydrological cycle — is the continuous circulation of water within the earth's hydrosphere, and is driven by solar radiation.</p>

Weight Lifting Vs Cardio For Fat Loss Reddit LOSWIE From loswie.blogspot.com
Burn less fat now and more later sounds the same to me. If your goal is to lose one to two pounds a week, you need a deficit of 1,000 calories per day. Cardio workout is surely one of the best approaches to losing weight and burning stubborn fat. Then, if it’s 10%&#43; higher than average, take that as a sign you need to take an unscheduled rest day to get back on track.

Regular physical activity causes many positive effects on the cardiovascular system and improves cardiorespiratory fitness.

Dehydration also increases heart rate during exercise. There are different conditioning factors during rest such as genetics, sex, age, psychological state, physical shape. In general, the benefits of regular physical activity far outweigh risks to the heart and lungs. Short term effects of exercise on the cardiovascular system.

Thus, the muscle metaboreflex contributes importantly to the regulation of the heart during exercise. The second heart beat, s2 is dub, the closing of semilunar valves.

<p>We will use a digital heart rate monitor strapped on our chest while we perform different levels of exercise. Use the timers and stethoscopes again to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds. Physical activity strengthens your heart and improves lung function. As physical exercise increases, sympathetic nerves stimulate the heart to beat with more force and faster to pump extra oxygen to the cells thus increasing the heart rate.

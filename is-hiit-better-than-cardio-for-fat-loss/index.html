While lifting weights can help you build muscle mass, that muscle mass will in turn help you lose fat mass. Hiit, or high intensity interval training, is a method of training where you perform an exercise at a high intensity for a specific duration followed by a period of low intensity exercise, then repeating the process. Sprint intervals are a favorite for those trying to gain muscle while staying relatively lean. And if you just want to lose fat and don&#39;t want to get hugely muscular, don&#39;t worry, that.

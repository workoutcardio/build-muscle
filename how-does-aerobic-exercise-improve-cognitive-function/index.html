Being on a waiting list for the exercise group) or with other. Aerobic exercise (aex) improves cognitive executive function (ef) processes in healthy individuals, although the learning benefits after stroke are unknown. Aerobic exercise did not improve cognitive function in processing speed, language, attention, or episodic memory for participants of any age. A new study finds that aerobic exercise slows down decreasing brain size in older age, helping to maintain cognitive function.

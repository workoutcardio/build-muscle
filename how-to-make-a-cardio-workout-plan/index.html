Indoor Cardio Challenge From darebee.com
Sure, dumbbells and barbells may look overwhelming at times, but strength training can help build lean muscle, increase bone strength, and prevent injury. The recommended number of days to perform this cardiovascular workout plan is 5 days per week but for less wear and tear on your muscles feel free to scale back to 3 days per week. Take your schedule, and choose one of your rest days and one of your five workout days for active recovery. Cycling (outdoors or on a machine) you should expect the workouts to start off with a low intensity, at least for the first 4 to 6 six weeks, and each routine lasting for 30 minutes.

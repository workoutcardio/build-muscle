<p>Cardiolipin is a unique phospholipid which is almost exclusively located in the inner mitochondrial membrane where it is biosynthesized. Cardiolipin is the principal phospholipid of the mitochondrial membrane and is implicated. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them for just a short while due to an infection or drug, or present but without symptoms as a person ages. Cardiolipin is a unique phospholipid that has particular importance to mitochondrial function, and therefore the production of energy for the entire body.</p>

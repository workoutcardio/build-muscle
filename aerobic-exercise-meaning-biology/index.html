biochemistry How does the body switch between aerobic and anaerobic From biology.stackexchange.com
Organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes use respiration mechanisms for the breakdown of food that may require environmental oxygen. Aerobic is defined as relating to, involving, or requiring oxygen, and refers to the use of oxygen to meet energy demands during exercise via aerobic metabolism adequately. Aerobic fitness is a potential prognostic tool in cystic fibrosis. Active exercise motion imparted to a part by voluntary contraction and relaxation of its controlling muscles.

Organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes use respiration mechanisms for the breakdown of food that may require environmental oxygen. Aerobic exercise increases the bodyâs capacity to absorb, deliver, and utilize oxygen. Pin on Healthcare illustration.</p>

<p>In contrast, anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen. Anaerobic literally means âwithout air,â so anaerobic exercise is an intense exercise that requires the body to use other sources of energy besides oxygen to fuel the muscles. Aerobic exercise is cardiovascular conditioning that strengthens both your heart and lungs.

Kaiser permanente explains that when your heart gets stronger, it pushes out more blood with every beat — which means it doesn&#39;t have to work as hard to circulate adequate oxygen and nutrients when you exercise. Then, count the number of beats in 30 seconds. Because when exercising, muscles in our body need more oxygen during a heavy exertion, causing an increased breathing rate with a little bit of panting. The easiest and most effective way to achieve a lasting lower heart rate is to do regular exercise.

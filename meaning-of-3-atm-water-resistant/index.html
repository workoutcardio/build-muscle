What dose water resistant 3 atm &amp; 5 atm &amp; 10 atm mean? YouTube From youtube.com
Therefore, at present, most smart. 3 atm means a resistance to the depth of 30 meters, 5 to 50 meters, and so on. In the first example, the watch may only be exposed to 30 cm water depth, in the second 1.50 meters. Watches with a rating of 100 m, 10 bar and 10 atm correspond in terms of water resistance.

<p>30 metres (3atm) a very common rating among dress watches, if your timepiece says 30 metres or 3atm (atm meaning atmospheres) then it does not mean it’s water resistant to 30 metres below sea level.

For example, 100m water resistance = 330 feet = 10 atm = 10.1325 bar. 5atm is similar to 3atm, that is to say, they are not very resistant to water at all. What Does Water Resistant 5 Atm Mean.</p>

<p>Every 10m of depth adds one atmosphere of pressure, hence the 5atm rating of the galaxy watch active2, galaxy watch active, galaxy fit, galaxy watch, gear sport and gear fit2 pro. The atm or “atmospheres” is the amount of pressure a watch can withstand. Water resistant is a common mark stamped on the back of wrist watches to indicate how well a watch is sealed against the ingress of water. 5atm is similar to 3atm, that is to say, they are not very resistant to water at all.

<p>Stated in units of pressure such as atmospheres (atms), or depth such as meters, water resistance levels typically range from 3 atm (30 meters) to 20 atm (200 meters) and diver's watches at 200+ meters. 5 bar, 5 atm, 50 meter (50m) water resistant withstands shower water.

<p>But 3atmospheres is a measure of pressure. It is important to note that this is a measure of pressure not depth. For example, if you jump flat from the edge of the pool into the water, the watch must withstand much higher pressure than if you let it glide gently to the ground in the pool. 3 bar, 3 atm, 30 meter (30m) is restistant to rain and splashing water with hand washing.

<p>That’s the textbook answer, but as you will soon discover, the true reality of it is a bit more complicated. It’s a measure of the watch’s resistance to pressure. Water resistant is a common mark stamped on the back of wrist watches to indicate how well a watch is sealed against the ingress of water. The simple answer is that 3 atm water resistant means that a watch is water resistant to a depth of 30 meters. 0.36.0 Bar 2 Watches Waterproof Tester Tool 6 ATM Watch Water.</p>

How does exercise affect your heart rate? GCSE Science Marked by From markedbyteachers.com
It is obvious that the breathing rate is directly proportional to heart rate and both should amalgamate during exercise to prevent illness (haldane, 2013). Standing still, take your heart rate and write down the number of beats per minute. What is the independent and dependant variable for how does heart rate change with exercise? The aha recommends a person gets at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise—exercise that elevates their heart rate to the target heart rate zone—on most days of the week, or a total.

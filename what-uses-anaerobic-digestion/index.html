Anaerobic Digestion Process Colloide Process Engineering From colloide.com
Anaerobic digestion is a biological process in which organic matter is converted by several independent, consecutive, and parallel reactions. The digestion of the waste takes place in an airtight container without the presence of oxygen. It uses four steps in the biological process, hydrolysis to.

<p>The leaves are like lungs collecting oxygen from the air and releasing carbon dioxide. The two primary vascular tissues are xylem, which transports water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves, and phloem, which conducts food from the leaves to all parts of the plant. Vascular plants have true roots, leaves, and stems because of the vascular system. The plants belonging to the group of the filicinea were the first vascular plants.</p>

<p>The leaves are like lungs collecting oxygen from the air and releasing carbon dioxide. One defining characteristic of the vascular plant is root, stem, and leaves. The two primary vascular tissues are xylem, which transports water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves, and phloem, which conducts food from the leaves to all parts of the plant.

<p>The leaves are like lungs collecting oxygen from the air and releasing carbon dioxide. The two primary vascular tissues are xylem, which transports water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves, and phloem, which conducts food from the leaves to all parts of the plant.

<p>The leaves are like lungs collecting oxygen from the air and releasing carbon dioxide. One defining characteristic of the vascular plant is root, stem, and leaves. The two primary vascular tissues are xylem, which transports water and dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves, and phloem, which conducts food from the leaves to all parts of the plant.

<h3 id="the-main-plant-body-is-the-diploid-sporophyte">The Main Plant Body Is The Diploid Sporophyte.</h3><p>The xylem is composed of nonliving cells (tracheids and vessel elements) that are stiffened by the presence of lignin, a hardening substance that reinforces the cellulose cell wall. Vascular plants have conducting, also referred to as vascular or liquefied, tissues that transport water, minerals, and photosynthetic materials throughout the plant’s roots, stems, and leaves.

What Is The Aerobic Threshold A Beginners Guide From strengthmatters.com
Advanced runners can try two threshold workouts per week in certain phases: It uses oxygen to generate power without accumulating any lactate byproduct that results in rapid fatigue. Your aerobic threshold is the highest point at which you’re primarily using your aerobic energy system. Hopefully, your speed/power at your aerobic threshold will increase but you can still use the same training zones and guidelines, such as staying in zones 1 and 2, and making sure you are keeping to a pace you can hold a conversation.

<meta name="description" content="Easy 10 Minutes Of Cardio After Weights For Diet, Doing cardio before lifting weights will use up most of your glycogen stores or your muscle energy. Here’s how you can do a cardio finisher at the end of your next strength workout.
10 Minute Full Body Cardio Workout with Optional Weights YouTube From youtube.com
Rowing 10,000 meters at a moderate pace takes me about 54 to 60 minutes, and as my body got stronger and my endurance improved, i started to crave longer workouts. Cardio and weight training signal opposite adaptations within the body. The cardio you gain from running will grant you more endurance to lift more weights for more reps, translating to more muscle. If you love running and are counting down the minutes to get going, do cardio first and weights after.

The american heart association recommends that you do exercise that increases your heart rate to between 50 and 85% of your maximum heart rate. This range is your target heart rate zone. If you had caffeine before exercise or you didn&#39;t drink enough fluids, that can affect your heart rate. Use the timers and stethoscopes again to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds.

<p>The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time). A young, healthy athlete may have a heart rate of 30 to 40 bpm. Because exercise has been shown to improve autonomic tone, it stands to reason that perhaps exercise training can improve abnormal heart rate recovery.

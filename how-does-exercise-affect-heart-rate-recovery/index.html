The american heart association recommends that you do exercise that increases your heart rate to between 50 and 85% of your maximum heart rate. This range is your target heart rate zone. If you had caffeine before exercise or you didn&#39;t drink enough fluids, that can affect your heart rate. Use the timers and stethoscopes again to record how many heartbeats you can hear in 30 seconds.

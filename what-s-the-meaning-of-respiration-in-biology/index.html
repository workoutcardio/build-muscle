<p>It is a process of release of energy from food substances such as glucose and fats under the control of enzymes, to carry out life processes, by. Organisms make use of such energy for their activities by oxidising these high energy food molecules into simple low energy molecules, i.e., carbon dioxide and water. It includes breathing, intake of oxygen, ejecting out co2, using the o2 obtained. The physiological definition of respiration differs from the biochemical definition, which refers to a metabolic process by which an organism obtains energy (in the form of atp.

<p>The heart rate and blood pressure are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. Exercise also signals the release of nitric oxide by the cells lining the insides of the blood vessels (endothelial cells). But these changes may take weeks, months, or even years to reach their full effect. As you begin to exercise, sympathetic nerves stimulate the heart to beat with more force and faster; MotiveWeight The Benefits of Doing Regular Aerobic Exercise.</p>

<p>Physical activity is one part. Now that more blood is pumping with each beat or contraction, you will begin to notice a reduction in your resting heart rate. This causes the cells that form the blood vessel walls (smooth muscle cells) to stay relaxed. âendurance training â like running or rowing â provides specific benefits to the heart,â says dieter.

Exercise also keeps your heart healthy by reducing the risk for heart failure, valve problems and irregular heartbeat. In a resting heart, the cardiac output is about 5 liters a minute (0.07 l x 70 beats/min = 4.9 l/min). When we exercise, we need more fuel to get to our muscles so your heart beats faster to get more of that fuel to your muscles to make energy.</p>
<h3 id="people-with-genetic-risk-factors-are-especially-vulnerable">People With Genetic Risk Factors Are Especially Vulnerable.</h3><p>As with many heart and lung diseases, the less active you are, the less you are able to translate that. To slow damage to their heart, patients need to do all. It also helps your sympathetic nervous system (which controls your heart rate and blood pressure) to be less reactive. Exercise also promotes positive physiological changes, such as encouraging the heart's arteries to dilate more readily.</p>

Muscular Endurance vs. Muscular Strength What&#39;s the Difference? Shape From shape.com
Cardiovascular fitness level is linked to heart failure risk and the likelihood of heart failure hospitalization later in life. Cardiovascular endurance refers to the capacity to exercise without becoming excessively fatigued as a result of having a healthy heart, lungs, and blood vessels. A person&#39;s ability to deliver oxygen to the working muscles is affected by many physiological parameters, including heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, and maximal oxygen consumption. A simple definition is that crf is a measure of how well your body takes in oxygen and distributes it to your muscles and organs.

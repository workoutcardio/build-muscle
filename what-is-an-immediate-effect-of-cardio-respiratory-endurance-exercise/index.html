Lesson 2 long term effects of exercise From slideshare.net
Health benefits of physical activity. Basically, it’s how well your heart and lungs can work together to pump blood, oxygen, and nutrients to exercising. According to wikipedia, cardiorespiratory fitness refers to the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity. This leads to an increased heart rate and increased circulation, which gets oxygenated blood to your muscles quicker.

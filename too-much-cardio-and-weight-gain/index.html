Is It Possible To Burn Fat Without Cardio? Geelong Medical &amp; Health Group From geelongmedicalgroup.com.au
Too much cardio can interfere with muscle growth—but so can too little. In fact, too much slow and steady cardio can actually store more fat, make you age faster and decrease muscle tone. Incurring small deficits of 250 to 500 calories, or even incurring deficits of 1,000 calories for larger, more active people, will encourage your body to use stored fat for energy so you will lose weight. Cardio has a ton of health benefits and even if you run a 5k every week you could literally just eat one extra protein snack that day to keep yourself in caloric surplus.

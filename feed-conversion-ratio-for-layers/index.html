He also shares common conventions and “rule of thumb” values regarding layers, such as the amount of feeds that a layer consumes in its lifetime, how many eggs are produced by 1kg of feeds, and many more. Feed conversion ratio (fcr) is simply defined as the mathematical relationship between the feed an animal consumes and the weight that the animal gains by consuming the feed.

<p>The fcr is simply the amount of feed it takes to grow a kilogram of fish. In this example, it would obviously be more economical to purchase the most expensive 36 % protein fish food. The rfi has been used as a production performance evaluation index for layer chickens since the 1970s. A layer chicken can last up to 2 years and would have consumed nearly 69kg of feed from day old until 2 years old of age. (PDF) Metabolizable energy and oil intake in brown commercial layers.</p>

<p>For example, if it requires two kilograms of feed to grow one kilogram of fish, the fcr would be two. This means that when a feed has a low fcr, it takes less feed to produce one kilogram of fish then it would if the fcr were higher. Feed accounts for the greatest proportion of egg production costs and there is substantial variation in feed to egg conversion ratio (fcr) efficiency between individual hens.

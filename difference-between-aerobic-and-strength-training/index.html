<meta name="description" content="15 Min Difference Between Aerobic And Strength Training For Man, Anaerobic training is more intense and demands a faster energy source. If aerobic conditioning follows strength work, then it should involve different muscle groups and low work volume (&lt;45 min) and intensity (&lt;70% vo2max).

Aerobic exercise also works your muscles, but not as much as strength training. The difference between aerobic and anaerobic training is the fuel source. Lifting weights, high intensity training, resistance based systems and more are all forms of anaerobic exercise. On the other hand strength training is primarily anaerobic in nature, meaning it is performed without sufficient oxygen.

<p>For most natural lifters, or anyone who lifts weights. Analysing 10 studies comparing muscle gain in people training muscles once, twice or three times weekly. Unfortunately there simply aren’t enough studies to make more concrete determinations as to the precise number of times that a muscle should be trained each week for optimal growth.

<p>Because your weight training frequency is low, you need to get that entire weekly workout volume in during each muscle’s one weekly workout. If you want to train that muscle twice a week, you could do 90 repetitions on monday, and 30 repetitions on thursday. As a beginner, you should grow from almost any training program.

Have a nice day, the other may well be thinking, i’ve just been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and i’m also coughing up thick. This test uses sound waves (ultrasound) to see if the heart&#39;s muscle is unusually thick. It also shows how well the heart&#39;s chambers and valves are pumping blood. During puberty in males, hypertrophy occurs at an increased rate.

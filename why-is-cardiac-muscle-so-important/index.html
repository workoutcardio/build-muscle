Why cAMP produces contraction in heart but relaxation in smooth muscle From egpat.com
Cardiac muscle differs from skeletal muscle in. This feature, however, also distinguishes it from smooth muscle, the third muscle type. In essence, cardiovascular fitness describes the efficiency in which the lungs, heart, and vascular system work in order to provide oxygen to the working muscles of the body so that the exertion of the muscles can be maintained.

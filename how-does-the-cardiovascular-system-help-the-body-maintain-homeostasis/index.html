Circulatory System Homeostasis All About Home From karentsbogsite.blogspot.com
The heart is a pump made of cardiac cells that circulates blood and lymph throughout the body. Homeostasis is the state of body in which body undergoes several chemical or physical changes to maintain the internal changes affected by external factors. As i mentioned beforehand, there are many ways our cardiovascular system can maintain homeostasis. Barry was on an antibiotic, but after he took all of it, he had a.

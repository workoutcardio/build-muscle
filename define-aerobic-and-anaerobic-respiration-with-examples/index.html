Different types of respiration can also depend. The differences between aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration include where the processes occur, what chemicals are involved in the processes, and what substances are produced by the two processes. Molecular oxygen is the most efficient electron acceptor for respiration, due to. Glucose &#43; electron acceptors (other than o2) → lactic acid / ethanol &#43; 2 atp molecules.

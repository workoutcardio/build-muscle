The recovery of initial values of hrv does not happen immediately after exercise; The relationship between autonomic function and recovery following prolonged arduous exercise in women has not been examined.

<p>However, athletes should avoid overtraining, however, since strenuous exercise lowers hrv in the short term. Lower hrv is often associated with high stress levels and the presence of other medical conditions, but higher values aren't always better. While this is a simplified view (see the study for the whole figures), i see that hr tended to go up in the overload phase and then reversed in the recovery phase.

<p>Heart rate variability (hrv) is a measurement of the time between heartbeats. In fact, strategic acute drops in hrv can be favorable as long as hrv recovers to normal or better levels. There is an increase in autonomic stress (as evidenced by delayed hrv recovery) once the first ventilatory (lactate) threshold was exceeded. If you are not at these levels, decrease the intensity of your workout and then gradually increase as your fitness level. HRV, Offseason, Changes in Training Load.</p>

<p>At five minutes post workout you should be 120 bpm or less. In fact, strategic acute drops in hrv can be favorable as long as hrv recovers to normal or better levels.

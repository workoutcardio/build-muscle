<p>The test requires a blood sample that is usually taken from a vein in the arm. Cardiolipin antibodies are classified as autoantibodies that act against the bodyâs own cardiolipins. In 1999, an international consensus conference found that one criterion for the serologic diagnosis of âdefinite antiphospholipid syndromeâ is the presence of anticardiolipin antibody of igg and/or igm isotype, at medium or high titer, on two or more occasions, at least six weeks apart. If the anticardiolipin antibodies test result in negative, then it means that the antibodies are not available or not available in the detectable level in the blood during the time when the test is performed.

<p>Tests for igg and igm cardiolipin antibodies are frequently ordered to help determine the cause of an unexplained thrombotic episode, recurrent miscarriage, or thrombocytopenia.they may be ordered along with lupus anticoagulant testing to help investigate the cause of a prolonged aptt (activated partial thromboplastin time), especially if clinical. Test results may vary depending on your age, gender, health history, the method used for the test, and other things. Fasting is not required to prepare for this test, and results will be delivered within one to two. One can test for all isotypes at once, or they can be detected separately.

<p>Following collection, serum should be separated from the clot. However, if these tests are negative and clinical suspicions still exist, then iga cardiolipin antibody testing may be ordered. When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. This test is typically performed when a patient experiences unexplained blood clots, recurrent miscarriages, or autoimmune disease symptoms [ 5 ]. A Case of Antiphospholipid Antibody Syndrome.</p>

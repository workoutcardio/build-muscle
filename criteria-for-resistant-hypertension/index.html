Resistant hypertension is generally defined as uncontrolled clinic blood pressure (&gt;140/90 mm hg) after treatment with three or more antihypertensives. Pregnancy, possible white coat hypertension, unusually variable blood pressure (1) notes: Among the vast population of hypertensive subjects, between 10 and 15% do not achieve an adequate blood pressure (bp) control despite the use of at least three antihypertensive agents. Two novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of resistant hypertension, have emerged in the last few months :

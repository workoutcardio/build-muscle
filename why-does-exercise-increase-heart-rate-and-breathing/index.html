When You Exercise What Happens To Your Heart Rate ExerciseWalls From exercisewalls.blogspot.com
During exercise, your breathing rate increases, and you also take in more air with each individual breath. This makes you breathe faster to keep up with the intake and removal of the gases during respiration. This is why when we exercise both pulse/heart rate and breathing rate increase. More oxygen is caught up in the lungs and sent to the working muscles when the breathing rate increases.

<p>Your lungs take in that increased oxygen, which mixes with your blood, and then goes to your heart, a highly effective pump that delivers blood to the rest of your body. More oxygen is needed as your body burns glucose to produce energy and that uses oxygen when performed aerobically. Your muscles need more oxygen than they normally use to burn these extra calories. This makes you breathe faster to keep up with the intake and removal of the gases during respiration.</p>

Your heart begins to beat quicker to deliver oxygenated blood to them. Your blood picks up oxygen as it travels through your lungs and delivers it to the muscles you're using.

Kaiser permanente explains that when your heart gets stronger, it pushes out more blood with every beat â which means it doesn't have to work as hard to circulate adequate oxygen and nutrients when you exercise. This is why when we exercise both pulse/heart rate and breathing rate increase. More oxygen is needed as your body burns glucose to produce energy and that uses oxygen when performed aerobically.

<p>Your blood picks up oxygen as it travels through your lungs and delivers it to the muscles you're using. Because blood picks up oxygen in the lungs during exercise and the demand for oxygen rises, the lungs must work harder. Your body produces more heat during exercise as well.

<h3 id="that-doesnt-necessarily-mean-that-youll-be-taking-more-breaths">That Doesnât Necessarily Mean That Youâll Be Taking More Breaths.</h3><p>Pulse rate is an indication of your heart rate as your arteries expand each time the ventricles pump blood out of the heart. This is why when we exercise both pulse/heart rate and breathing rate increase. The direct relationship between exercise and respiratory rate is that you will begin to take in more oxygen â about three to four times as much, to be exact. When you exercise and your muscles work harder, your body uses more oxygen and produces more carbon dioxide.</p>

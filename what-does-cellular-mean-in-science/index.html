Cellular refers to a network technology that facilitates mobile device communication over areas comprised of cells and transceivers, which are also known as base stations or cell sites. However, it also means that they require a constant supply of oxygen, or. Some cells are organisms unto themselves; They may exist as independent units of life (as in monads) or may form colonies or tissues as in higher plants and animals) derivation:

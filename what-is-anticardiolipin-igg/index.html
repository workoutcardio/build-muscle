Anticardiolipins are antibodies produced by the immune system against the platelet membrane phospholipids responsible for the coagulation of blood clots. There are different classes (isotypes) of anticardiolipin antibody, namely igg, igm, and iga. These antibodies are found in patients with various ailments including arterial and venous thrombosis, connective tissue diseases, syphilis, antiphospholipid syndrome, livedoid vasculitis.

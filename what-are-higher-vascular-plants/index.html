The Higher Vascular Plants authorSTREAM From authorstream.com
The vascular plants , also known as tracheophytes or cormofitas , belong to the group tracheophyta. In general i would prefer tracheophytes or vascular plants, because it make clear and implicit in the name what is the exact classification. Nonvascular plants do not have vascular systems, do not have true leaves, roots. In the tropical part of the range (halloy 1991 ).

The vascular plants, or tracheophytes, are plants that have specialized tissues for conducting water, minerals, and photosynthetic products through the plant.

The vascular plants, or tracheophytes, are plants that have specialized tissues for conducting water, minerals, and photosynthetic products through the plant. The vascular plants , also known as tracheophytes or cormofitas , belong to the group tracheophyta. Vascular plants become tall due to the structural support gained from its lignified xylem.</p>

Vascular plants are those plants in which vascular tissue in the form of xylem and phloem is present. Other groups include the whisk ferns (psilotophyta), club and spike mosses (lycophyta), and horsetails.

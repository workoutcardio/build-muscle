Once you go above this intensity, blood lactate levels begin to rise. Exercise at 60% of anaerobic threshold did not improve ef, and exercises completed at 110% of anaerobic threshold only improved performance in verbal fluency. Healthy adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75. However, the combination of aerobic and anaerobic exercise may utilize more fat than either type of exercise alone, particularly since greater recovery is required between sessions of anaerobic activity.

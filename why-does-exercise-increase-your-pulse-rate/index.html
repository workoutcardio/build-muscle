<p>As the amount of blood increased, the heart rate also increased to meet the demand for nutrients and oxygen. This demand will cause sympathetic nerves to stimulate the heart to beat faster and with more force to increase overall blood flow. As mentioned above, the heart rate or pulse rate increases and decreases to adjust with the body's requirement of oxygen at different times and while undertaking different activities. Reasons behind increased heart rate when exercising.</p>

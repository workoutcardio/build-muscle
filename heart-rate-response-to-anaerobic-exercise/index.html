The maximal rate of heart rate increase (rhri), a marker of heart rate acceleration has been shown to correlate with performance changes. However, the cardiac response to exercise has rarely been examined in sea turtles. Muscles need energy to contract. Edexcel GCSE PE 1.2.2Cardiovascular.</p>

In anaerobic exercise, such as weightlifting and sprinting, your body’s need for oxygen exceeds the oxygen that is available. The cardiovascular system responds rapidly to anaerobic exercise, increasing heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, blood flow to muscles and systolic blood pressure.

<p>The term anaerobic means “without oxygen.”. As with aerobic exercise, anaerobic exercise temporarily changes your vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate and body temperature 1 2. The ultimate goal of the cardiovascular response to acute aerobic exercise is to maximize cardiac output and match the metabolic demands of the musculoskeletal system. In order to change cardiac output, there may be a change in either heart rate or stroke volume.  Heart rate responses and the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) for.</p>

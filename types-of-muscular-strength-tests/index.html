<p>Around 1880, physical testing shifted from anatomical proportions to muscular strength. This is an example of the extra muscle strength we all have in reserve for situations of stress. Specifically, the main aims of the study were to assess the reliability of different efp tests, to examine their relationship with maximum muscle strength, and to explore the relationship between efp tests and functional movement performance. However, many tasks require the ability to move a mass through gravity in multiple planes of motion. 15 fitness assessment.</p>

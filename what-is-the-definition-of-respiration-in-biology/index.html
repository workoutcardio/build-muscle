Aerobic respiration can take place in two types. This is generally finished with the intake of oxygen and this leads to the discharge of greenhouse gas, water, and atp. Definition of respiration in biology the organism requires energy to perform their activities. It is the process of exchange between environmental oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body cells without any need for special respiratory organs or blood.

<p>One of the byproducts of respiration is carbon dioxide. The process of respiration occurs in the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The first is the series of conducting tubes that carry air from the atmosphere towards the lungs. On the other hand, however, the “meaning” encompasses the impact of metabolism on biological systems at the most fundamental levels, as well both philosophical and applied aspects.

<p>As we have learned in our article on photosynthesis, cells cannot directly use glucose as a source of energy. The whole process of respiration can be split into three stages: Aerobic respiration is that the method of cellular respiration that takes place within the presence of oxygen gas. It is a process of release of energy from food substances such as glucose and fats under the control of enzymes, to carry out life processes, by the living organisms.

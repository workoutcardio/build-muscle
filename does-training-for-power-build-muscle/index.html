<p>Most of us know that strength training (with free weights, weight machines, or resistance bands) can help build and maintain muscle mass and strength. Adaptations to power training are an increased firing frequency, which means the muscle fibers get activated much faster and an improved synchronization, which refers to agonistic (working muscles) are activated while antagonistic muscles (opposing muscles) are deactivated. “power development requires heavy weight, high sets, and low reps,” caldwell says.

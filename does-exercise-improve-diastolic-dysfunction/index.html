However, the maximal exercise mean arterial pressure increased in the control group with type 1 diabetes after 20 weeks. Patients may begin to reverse the stiffness of the heart muscle and prevent the onset of diastolic heart failure. Is it possible to reverse my diastolic dysfunction (dd), stage one with e/a ratio of.7 at my female age of 63? Impairment of diastolic function could result in the inability to increase cardiac output adequately and can limit exercise capacity.

How Is Cardiorespiratory Endurance Measured? From livestrong.com
Cardiorespiratory fitness is a measure of the heart and lung&#39;s functionality. Follow the links below to assess your current level of cardiorespiratory fitness. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) is associated with mortality and cardiovascular disease, but assessing crf in the population is challenging. A review of the literature strongly suggests that step tests can give reliable and valid measures of cardiorespiratory fitness provided that (a) the subjects have received adequate instruction and practice in taking the test prior to the criterion test performance, and (b) the work load is above a certain threshold.

<p>You can repeat these tests down the road to help measure your progress and keep you motivated. Cardiorespiratory endurance is determined by the amount of oxygen taken in by the body (vo2 max) and how efficiently it is utilised during vigorous activity. To classify cardiorespiratory fitness (crf), we measure maximum oxygen consumption (vo 2 max). Vo 2 max is generally measured in laboratories using treadmill running, cycling, or rowing ergometers by progressively increasing intensity over a time period.</p>

<p>Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) is associated with mortality and cardiovascular disease, but assessing crf in the population is challenging. Cardiorespiratory fitness is how well the body processes oxygen. It is the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to the skeletal muscles during any sustained physical activity. It is well accepted that the gold standard indirect method of measuring vo 2 max is by using a gas analyses system. Fitness Testing Cardio, Flexibility, Strength, Body Composition.</p>

<p>The following sections review the strength of the evidence for a relationship between health outcomes and the four categories of fitness tests for cardiorespiratory endurance (distance/timed run, shuttle run, treadmill, and cycle ergometer). Your doctor can measure cardiorespiratory fitness through what's called your maximal oxygen consumption (vo2 max) or from readings taken while you do an aerobic workout. Some of the tests that can be used to measure cardiorespiratory fitness are the 2.4 km run test, the astrand treadmill test and the multistage bleep test. Generally speaking, lower blood pressure and a lower resting pulse rate indicate healthy cardiovascular function, while high lung capacity in conjunction with good blood oxygenation indicate good respiratory fitness.

<p>The committee's recommendations for the selection. A review of the literature strongly suggests that step tests can give reliable and valid measures of cardiorespiratory fitness provided that (a) the subjects have received adequate instruction and practice in taking the test prior to the criterion test performance, and (b) the work load is above a certain threshold. Vo 2 max is generally measured in laboratories using treadmill running, cycling, or rowing ergometers by progressively increasing intensity over a time period.

It occurs in some yeasts and bacteria and in muscle when exercise is strenuous and there is not enough oxygen. Anaerobic means without air (an means without). Fermentation is defined as the anaerobic breakdown of carbohydrates and other organic compounds into alcohols, organic acids, gases, etc. Respiration all organisms respire in order to release energy to fuel their living processes.

<p>Respiration is used by all cells to turn fuel into energy that can be used to power cellular processes. Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy. In this process one molecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of. Simply, anaerobic respiration can be defined as the cellular respiration process occurring in an anoxic environment i.e.</p>

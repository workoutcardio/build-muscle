Doing anaerobic exercise will burn calories faster and will boost your metabolism so you continue burning calories at a high rate for the rest of the day. The body works to break down carbs from blood glucose or glucose stored in the muscles for energy, and while this is an effective way to do so, it only lasts for a short period of time ().this makes anaerobic exercise great for short, intense.

The aerobic threshold is the point where exercise intensity increases enough that the body can no longer supply enough oxygen to cover its total fuel utilization. Aerobic fitness is a measure of the body&#39;s capacity to transport and utilize oxygen. Numerous studies have demonstrated that cardiorespiratory fitness (oxygen. For runners, it is essential to know the difference between aerobic (when muscles contract by consuming oxygen) and anaerobic (when muscles contract without oxygen consumption).

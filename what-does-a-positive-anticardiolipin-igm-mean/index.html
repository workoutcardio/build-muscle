<p>The test measures igg and igm levels. The iga ( immunoglobulin a) test detects the presence of the cardiolipin antibodies in the blood. When the antibodies attack cardiolipin, blood clots can occur. A negative anticardiolipin igg or igm result indicates that this type of antibody was not present or was present in too small a quantity in the blood sample being tested. Sle by dr qudsia.</p>

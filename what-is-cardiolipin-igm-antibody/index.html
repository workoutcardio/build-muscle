Cardiolipin antibodies are classified as autoantibodies that act against the body’s own cardiolipins.
Human anticardiolipin antibody(IgM) ELISA Kit Cepham Life Sciences From cephamls.com
Anticardiolipins are antibodies produced by the immune system against the platelet membrane phospholipids responsible for the coagulation of blood clots. The levels of these antibodies are often high in people with abnormal blood. Since cardiolipin antibodies are the most common of the antiphospholipid antibodies, it is not unusual to find them emerging, temporarily due to an infection or drug, or asymptomatically as a person ages. The iga ( immunoglobulin a) test detects the presence of the cardiolipin antibodies in the blood.

<p>Anticardiolipins are antibodies produced by the immune system against the platelet membrane phospholipids responsible for the coagulation of blood clots. The antibodies attack cardiolipins by mistake. The persistent presence of igg and/or igm cardiolipin (cl) antibodies in moderate or high levels (greater than 40 gpl and/or greater than 40 mpl units) is a laboratory criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (aps). Cardiolipin antibodies (ca) are seen in a subgroup of patients with autoimmune disorders, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (sle), who are at risk for vascular thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, cerebral infarct and/or recurrent.

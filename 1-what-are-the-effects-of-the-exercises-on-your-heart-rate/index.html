<h3 id="during-physical-exercise-more-oxygen-is-needed-for-energy-production">During Physical Exercise, More Oxygen Is Needed For Energy Production.</h3><p>This is fairly obvious for most students in my age group, but the next question asks them to determine the recovery time and compare how recovery times differ for individuals. ‘’ during physical exercise, requirements for oxygen and substrate in skeletal muscle are increased, as are the removal. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit. Heart rate increases as you exercise to deliver more blood and oxygen to your working muscles.</p>

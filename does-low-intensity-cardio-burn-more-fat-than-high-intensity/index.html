<p>Of course the truth is, that was a disingenuous argument, an unfair comparison, and according the newest research, just plain wrong. For instance, if you do a low intensity cardio for 30 minutes, you may get a higher percentage coming from fat, but you have done a low intensity, so you have not burned that many calories. You get more bang for the buck when muscles burn fat compared. By now you are probably going nuts thinking: Cardio Intensity Low, Moderate, or High? Eat More 2 Weigh Less.</p>

<p>Although mobilization of fats goes down as intensity increases, the total oxidation of total fats is greater because more calories were burned, but at a lower rate of burned fat. The intervals can last anywhere from 20 seconds to one minute, depending on the hiit protocol. During low intensity cardio, the rate at which oxidation occurs in ffa's in much higher than in high intensity cardio. But at higher intensities you burn way more total calories and more fat calories overall than you do at lower intensities. Cardio vs Weights (Best Way to Burn Fat).</p>

<p>When you exercise at a low intensity the ration is about 50% carbohydrate and 50% fat as a fuel source. Working out at a low to moderate intensity for an extended period of time, 60 to 90 minutes for example, will burn fat, but it won't be at a level that gets you to your goals.

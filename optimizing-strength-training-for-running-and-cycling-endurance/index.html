<p>Optimizing strength training for running and cycling endurance performance date: Equivocal findings exist regarding the effects on power output or velocity at the lactate threshold. However, heavy strength training is recommended for improving cycling economy. Combining endurance training with either explosive or heavy strength training can improve running performance, while there is most compelling evidence of an additive effect on cycling performance when heavy strength training is used.</p>

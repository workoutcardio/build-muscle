According to li et al., (2018), the rate of breathing is critically important in improving the hrv. Train easier, but more often. Deep, controlled breathing exercises help activate your parasympathetic nervous system response, helping your body and mind relax. The greater the variability of the heart is, the more likely it is that the body will be able to perform well, physically and mentally.

<p>Arteries carry blood away from the heart and veins carry blood back to the heart. Since blood circulates only inside blood vessels it can do it with more pressure reaching farther distances between the organs where hematosis happens and the peripheral tissues. The key difference between single and double circulation is that in single circulation, blood travels once through the heart during a complete cycle, while in double circulation, blood flows twice through the heart during a complete cycle. Both the cardiovascular system and the circulatory system are not the same. Difference Between Vein And Artery With Structures And Coparison Table.</p>

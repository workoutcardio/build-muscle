‘m is the point of the moving circle that traces the cardioid.’. A cardioid is a mathematical shape that resembles a heart or the cross section of an apple cut in half. A cardioid is basically the shape created by using one point on a circle and rolling it around on another circle with the same radius. It is a curve which is defined as the locus of a point lying on the circumference of a circle that is rolling externally without any slip on the boundary of another circle of the same radius.

For any test measuring cardiovascular endurance, there are standardized tables that allow you to rate your. Measure your radial pulse in a completely relaxed state and count the number of beats in 1 minute. Moderate risk = 70 to 75 beats/min, high risk = 76 to 80 beats/min, above 80 beats/min the risk is three times normal. Marco recommends tracking resting or active heart rate for tracking overall cardiovascular fitness.

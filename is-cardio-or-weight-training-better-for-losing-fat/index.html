Cardio vs Weight Training for Fat Loss Which is BETTER? YouTube From youtube.com
Cardio will definitely change your body shape from weight loss, although often this weight loss comes from both fat and muscle so essentially your proportions shrink. It’s important that you don’t ditch the weights in favor of cardio to lose weight, or you can substantially slow your rate of fat loss. I spent 1 year lifting without changing my diet or doing cardio and i gained a lot of muscle mass and after a year weighed 265lbs. The best way to get in great physical condition is to combine weight training and running.

Because it depends on both volume and amount of time, cardiac output is a rate expressed as liters per. The normal resting heart rate for adults over the age of 10 years, including older adults, is between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm). Exercise and your heart rate Cardiac output is an excellent example to exhibit the efficiency of the human heart.

Conclusion continuous support should be provided to patients to maintain optimal crf levels after completing a cr program. Low crf is a strong predictor of the risk of stroke. The difference between the predicted maximum minute ventilation and the actual maximum minute ventilation during the cpet is the “ventilatory reserve”. An appointment lasts for around an hour.

<p>Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. Over the past 20 years, several studies have shown that individuals with low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (unfit individuals) have higher systolic blood pressure (sbp) and diastolic blood pressure (dbp) at rest than fit individuals, thereby increasing cardiovascular disease (cvd) risk. Cardiopulmonary fitness was measured in the form of fac, which was calculated as actual exercise duration/predicted exercise time×100. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (cpet) is an exercise test for analyzing both diagnostic and prognostic assessment by evaluating both submaximal and peak exercise response involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular, hematopoietic, neuropsychological, and skeletal muscle systems[1], cpet is aimed at the evaluation of exercise performance, functional capacity, and impairment.

<p>Periodic crf assessment can have an important preventive function. The difference between the predicted maximum minute ventilation and the actual maximum minute ventilation during the cpet is the “ventilatory reserve”. If the mve is &gt; 85% of predicted (i.e., the ventilatory reserve is &lt; 15%), then the patient is abnormally limited by pulmonary disease.

Aerobic respiration is cellular respiration that requires oxygen while anaerobic respiration does not. The sugar is completely broken down to carbon dioxide and water, yielding a maximum of 38 molecules of atp per molecule of glucose. This is in contrast to the highly efficient process of aerobic respiration, which relies on oxygen to produce energy.

<p>Animals are multicellular, made of many cells. Respiration is an important chemical process that releases the energy required for life processes. A type of cell respiration that takes place in anaerobes, and in which energy is released from glucose and other foods without the presence of oxygen. In addition to aerobic respiration, there is also anaerobic respiration, which is the conversion of sugars into energy in environments where oxygen isn’t present.

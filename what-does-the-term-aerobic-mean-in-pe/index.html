Aerobic endurance is the body’s ability to sustain medium to high intensity physical exercise for extended periods of time through the continual acquasition of oxygen. The term aerobic actually means with oxygen, which means that breathing controls the amount of oxygen that can make it to the muscles to help them burn fuel and move. Aerobic means “with air,” and it refers to the process through which the body produces energy via the utilization of oxygen. It does decrease with age and lifestyle choices.

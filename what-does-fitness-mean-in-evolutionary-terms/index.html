<p>What does the term fitness mean in relation to evolutionary. So if brown beetles consistently leave more offspring than green beetles because of their color, you’d say that the brown beetles had a higher fitness. Evolutionary biologists use the word fitness to describe how good a particular genotype is at leaving offspring in the next generation relative to other genotypes. Others pupate on green stems or leaves. What Does Fitness Mean When Speaking In Terms Of Evolution czego.</p>

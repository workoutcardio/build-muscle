<p>Objectivethe aim was to study the relationship between aerobic training and heart rate. The main objective of doing cardiovascular exercise is to have the ideal heart rate and have a good heart rate for our heart. Heart rate responds to training by increasing from the resting value and is often used to set or determine the intensity of the training session.

<p>Identify the comorbidities that influence peak heart rate and determine the relationship between exercise heart rate and sex. We sought to investigate right heart remodeling and function in elite athlees, as well as the relationship between parameters of right ventricular (rv) and right atrial (ra) remodeling and indices of aerobic capacity. The direct relationship between exercise and respiratory rate is that you will begin to take in more oxygen — about three to four times as much, to be exact. The american heart association notes that if you are calm, relaxed, not ill and are sitting or lying down, your resting heart rate is typically between 60 beats per minute and 100 bpm.

<p>Unlike a heart attack, heart failure is not sudden but a chronic condition in which the heart muscles become weak and fail to pump enough blood to meet the body s requirements. Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for development of coronary artery disease (cad), however, several reports have suggested that low serum cholesterol is associated with a worse prognosis in patients with congestive heart failure (chf). Coronary artery disease secondary to atherosclerosis is the most prevalent cause for ischemic cardiomyopathy; Lowering blood pressure can be done safely.</p>

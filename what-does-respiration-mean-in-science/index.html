What Are The Reactants In The Equation For Cellular Respiration? What From kathrynwaseltory.blogspot.com
Respiration is a chemical reaction. It usually involves exchanging two gases—oxygen and carbon dioxide. Respiration as a noun means the processes by which a living organism or cell takes in oxygen from the air or water, distributes and utilizes it in o. The sum total of the physical and chemical processes in an organism by which oxygen is conveyed to tissues and cells, and the oxidation products, carbon dioxide and water, are given off.

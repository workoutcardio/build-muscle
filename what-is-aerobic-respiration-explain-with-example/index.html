During this process, oxygen is not present. Here glucose molecule is completely oxidized into energy (atp), carbon dioxide, and water. While cellular respiration (aerobic) requires oxygen to create energy and leaves co2 as a byproduct, photosynthesis uses co2 to create energy and leaves oxygen as a byproduct. Organisms such as prokaryotes and eukaryotes use respiration mechanisms for the breakdown of food that may require environmental oxygen.

<p>Respiration is of two types, aerobic respiration, and anaerobic respiration. It is the release of a relatively large amount of energy in cells by the breakdown of food substances in the presence of oxygen. The energy they require, these are carried to the muscle via the blood. Aerobic respiration requires oxygen, whereas anaerobic respiration takes place in the absence of oxygen.</p>

<p>The primary difference between aerobic and anaerobic respiration is the presence or absence of oxygen during the processes. In this process, a food molecule breaks down. It is the process of cellular respiration that takes place in the presence of oxygen gas to produce energy from food. Although carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are.

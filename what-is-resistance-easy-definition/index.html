Conversely, the resistance value will increase as the current decreases. Resistance is a measure of the opposition to current flow in an electrical circuit also known as ohmic resistance or electrical resistance. Resistance training is any exercise that causes the muscles to contract against an external resistance with the expectation of increases in strength, power, hypertrophy, and/or endurance. The ratio of the applied voltage to the current through the material is then known as resistance.

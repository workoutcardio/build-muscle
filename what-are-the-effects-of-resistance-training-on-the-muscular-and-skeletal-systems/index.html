<p>The effects of resistance training on the muscular and skeletal systems are increasing muscle strength, preventing injuries, and altering muscle fiber distribution. In addition to the obvious effects of resistance training on muscle mass and strength, resistance training may lead to decreased risk for osteoporosis, fractures, and falls in later. Adaptations of the skeletal system occur only over the long term. Resistance training is based on the principle that muscles of the body will work to overcome a resistance force when they are required to do so.

<p>As humans age, there is a decrease in the ability of skeletal muscle to generate force. In this review, we examined the responses of skeletal muscles and tendons to exercise and their possible implications in the development of positive and negative effects associated with acute and chronic exercise such as muscle function changes, muscle soreness, and muscle and tendon hypertrophy. This is due to the fact that the exercise is helping the muscular and skeletal systems help the person who is doing it build their muscle and skeletal strength and endurance. Resistance training is based on the principle that muscles of the body will work to overcome a resistance force when they are required to do so.

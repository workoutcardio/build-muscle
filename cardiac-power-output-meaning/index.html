Cardiac Shock Care Centers JACC Review Topic of the Week Journal of From jacc.org
A normal adult has a cardiac output of 4.7 liters (5 quarts) of blood per minute. Cardiac power is a novel hemodynamic parameter. Cardiac output is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per minute. The body’s demand for oxygen changes, such as during exercise, and the cardiac output is altered by modulating both heart rate (hr) and stroke volume (sv).

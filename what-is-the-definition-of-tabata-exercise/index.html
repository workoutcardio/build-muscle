Tabata Workout 48 Minute Cardio Tabata Exercises YouTube From youtube.com
Tabata is a form of high intensity interval training (hiit) with very short, precise intervals. It was later named for scientist izumi tabata who studied the effectiveness of the routine. The control group exercised for one hour five times a week, at a moderate level of intensity. Much like hiit, tabata’s workout is designed to elevate the heart rate to a high anaerobic zone, meaning the body burns carbohydrates more readily than fats and gives the body just a short period to recover.

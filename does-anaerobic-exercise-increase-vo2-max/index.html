What’s the best way to improve VO2 max From span.health
Oxygen is needed to produce energy and the harder you exercise the more oxygen. Vo2 max is an important metric for endurance athletes. Vo2 max and anaerobic (sometimes called lactate) thresholds can be improved with specific training in your individual zones. Endurance running is aerobic exercise, which means it depends upon the use of oxygen.

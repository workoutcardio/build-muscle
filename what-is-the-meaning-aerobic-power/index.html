Difference between Aerobic and Anaerobic Respiration From bestdifferencebetween.com
An important clinical and research measurement. This energy system can extend out work for hours or sometimes days. Aerobic respiration is the process by which organisms use oxygen to turn fuel, such as fats and sugars, into chemical energy. Aerobic exercises like running and swimming.

<p>In contrast, anaerobic respiration does not use oxygen. Strengthening the heart and lungs by making them work hard for several minutes or more. Aerobic (which means âusing oxygenâ) physical activity, in which the bodyâs larger muscles move in a rhythmic manner for a sustained period of time and increase the bodyâs need for oxygen, are the best exercises to enhance cardiorespiratory endurance. The aerobic threshold is the uppermost limit of exercise when the production of energy starts to become dominated by anaerobic glycolysis (sugars) rather than the oxidation (aerobic in nature) of fats.

<p>Maximal aerobic power describes the functional capacity of the cardiorespiratory system and is defined as the maximum rate at which oxygen can be used during a specified period, usually during intense exercise. The aerobic threshold is the uppermost limit of exercise when the production of energy starts to become dominated by anaerobic glycolysis (sugars) rather than the oxidation (aerobic in nature) of fats. The aerobic system, also known as aerobic glycolysis, powers continuous steady state exercise longer than three to four minutes. In the aerobic system energy (atp) is produced through pyruvic acid and lipid/protein fragments entering the kreb cycle and the electron transport cycle (mcardle, 1991).

<p>Aerobic respiration plays a significant role in releasing a lot of energy which helps in the survival of life. This means that the aerobic energy system relies on the circulatory system (breathing in oxygen) in order to create adenosine triphosphate (atp) for energy use. It is the forgotten training threshold, overshadowed by its big brother, the anaerobic threshold. During aerobic exercise, your heart pumps oxygenated blood to working muscles to help them burn fat and carbohydrate for fuel, which in turn enables you to perform for extended periods.

<p>Waking up the aerobic energy system. Aerobic (which means âusing oxygenâ) physical activity, in which the bodyâs larger muscles move in a rhythmic manner for a sustained period of time and increase the bodyâs need for oxygen, are the best exercises to enhance cardiorespiratory endurance. In the aerobic system energy (atp) is produced through pyruvic acid and lipid/protein fragments entering the kreb cycle and the electron transport cycle (mcardle, 1991).

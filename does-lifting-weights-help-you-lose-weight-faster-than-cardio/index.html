When you’re lifting weights, your caloric burn can change greatly depending on the weights you’re using and the muscles you’re working on. Certain weight lifting exercises require your whole body to engage, torching calories and building muscle at the same time. Another very beneficial effect of lifting weights in combination with overall weight loss, is that it greatly improves your insulin sensitivity. If you can only manage a couple of exercise sessions a week, you can do some running or walking to lose weight on one day, and a hiit workout in front of the television on the other day.

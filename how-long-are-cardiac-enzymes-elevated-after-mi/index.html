Cardiac troponin t is measured in in nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). Paek level is 24 to 48 hours after the ami attack. Because the heart is the only organ that makes troponin, a biomarker test for this enzyme is the primary test healthcare providers use to detect heart damage from a heart attack or acs. Can stress cause elevated cardiac enzymes?

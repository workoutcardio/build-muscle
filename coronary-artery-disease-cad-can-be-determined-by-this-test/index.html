<p>An electrocardiogram will be done to look at the electrical activity of the heart. It is the most common of the cardiovascular diseases. An ecg is a test that measures and records the heart’s electrical impulses to show the strength of these impulses as they travel through the heart, as. After multivariable adjustment, patients who underwent cad testing were more likely to be younger, male, diagnosed in an acute care setting, and have systolic dysfunction or recent cardiogenic shock.

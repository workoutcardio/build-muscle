<p>Over a period of time, as you grow stronger, it is important to challenge the muscle to lift more for general progress of your strength. William kraemer, the duke kahanamoku of modern weightlifting theory, stressed in his landmark 2004 paper that using high loads was absolutely necessary so that we could recruit the max number of muscle motor units and thus fully realize a muscle's growth potential. Heavy weights develop more than just muscle. When programming for muscle size, volume is key. 25 Ways to Get Hench Increase Muscle Mass with These Tips.</p>

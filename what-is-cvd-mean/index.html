If your risk score is more than 15%, you are thought to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease (cvd), that is heart, stroke or blood vessel disease, in the next five years. Horizontal and vertical cvd describes the reactor configuration and direction of gas flow towards the substrate with horizontal tube reactors being the most common. Conversely, if the cvd line is positive sloping, it means that there is more demand for the asset.</p>

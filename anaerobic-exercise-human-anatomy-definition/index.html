<p>Anaerobic infections typically cause abscesses (buildups of pus), and death of tissue. In order to immediately meet the sudden higher energy demand, stored atp is the first energy source. In general, aerobic processes use the oxygen to produce more energy than anaerobic processes, but anaerobic processes release energy faster. Listed below are ten great anaerobic exercises to include in your workouts for building muscle, losing fat and boosting your endurance.</p>

<p>Fast twitch muscles (as compared to slow twitch muscles) operate using anaerobic metabolic systems, such that any use of fast twitch muscle fibers leads to an increased anaerobic energy expenditure. In fact, anaerobic means absence of oxygen. this can be contrasted with aerobic exercise that consumes oxygen at a sustainable pace such that an activity can be continued for a long duration of time. Anaerobic exercises cause an oxygen debt, which is a lack of oxygen in the muscles of the body. Creatine is a naturally occurring substance that regenerates atp during maximum anaerobic exercise.

<p>A good rule of thumb, sklaver says, is to eat 25 percent of your daily carbohydrate allotment 1 to 4 hours before a workout and another 25 percent within 45 minutes of finishing your workout. The best foods to eat before exercising depend on the type of workout and a person’s goals. (or a ratio of 40 grams of carbs to 10 grams of protein.) try chocolate milk to refuel and get the protein your muscles need to. Carbs are stored in the muscles as glycogen, and the more activity your muscles are engaged in, the more glycogen will be needed for proper functioning.

In general regular exercise does not substantially change measures of pulmonary function such as total lung capacity, the volume of air in the lungs after taking the largest breath possible (tlc), and forced vital capacity, the amount of air able to be blown out after taking the largest breath possible (fvc). Your body may need up to 15 times more oxygen when you exercise, so you start to breathe faster and heavier. Breathing &amp; Respiratory System Revision World.</p>

<p>The terms aerobic and anaerobic were coined by biochemists over 60 years ago to describe how our cells break down sugars. In fact, the reason is on account of anaerobic metabolism process. With the anaerobic threshold is meant the heart rate point or the training pace at which the muscles can take in just enough oxygen to balance the production and breakdown of lactic acid. Listed below are ten great anaerobic exercises to include in your workouts for building muscle, losing fat and boosting your endurance.</p>

This demand will cause sympathetic nerves to stimulate the heart to beat faster and with more force to increase overall blood flow. This is because the body’s muscles require more oxygen to carry out aerobic activities than when the body is resting. As you exercise more strenuously, the sympathetic system “kicks in” to accelerate your heart rate even more. Engaging in exercise causes the heart’s systolic blood pressure (blood vessel pressure during a heartbeat) to rise for a short time.

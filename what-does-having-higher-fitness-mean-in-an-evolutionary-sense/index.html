What events can lead to offspring having a unique arrangement of their parents’ genes? It is relative to competitors in a species, it is relative to an environment, and it is a statistical. The fitness of a genotype is determined by its capacity to survive, find a mate, have children, and, eventually, pass on its genes to the next generation of individuals. Evolutionary fitness is how well a species is able to survive and reproduce in its environment.

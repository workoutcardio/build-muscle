<p>Heart failure can have identifiable or unknown causes. Heart failure is a clinical syndrome with typical symptoms (breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) and signs (elevated jugular venous pressure, basal crepitations, and peripheral oedema). The heart stretches to contract more strongly and keep up with the demand to pump. Patients progress to a condition where traditional treatment is no longer effective and advanced therapies, such as mechanical circulatory support, heart transplantation and/or palliative care, are needed.</p>

Importance of Aerobics From slideshare.net
Aerobic exercise is cardiovascular conditioning that strengthens both your heart and lungs. Aerobic means “with oxygen,” and anaerobic means “without oxygen.” anaerobic exercise is the type where you get out of breath in just a few moments, like when you lift weights for improving strength, when you sprint, or when you climb a long flight of stairs. Testing for aerobic fitness identifies the efficiency with which the body can transport oxygen in the blood to the heart where it is distributed to the muscles, and the capacity of the muscles to use the oxygen received.

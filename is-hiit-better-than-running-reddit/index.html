Why Fitness Is Better Than Weight Loss Weight Loss From indiatimes.com
I&#39;d do both, but if i had to pick one, hiit. Which, in the long run, will be more beneficial to someone&#39;s overall health and longevity than simple fat loss.

I am a phd candidate currently studying hiit training in metabolic syndrome patients.

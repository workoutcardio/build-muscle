(1) arterial and/or venous thrombosis; I do not have a history of miscarriage, but do have a history of infertility (3 years). These are autoantibodies directed against components of the cellular membrane. The anti cardiolipin igm antibody test enables you to diagnose inappropriate blood clot, analyze the cause for regular miscarriages, and analyze any autoimmune diseases.

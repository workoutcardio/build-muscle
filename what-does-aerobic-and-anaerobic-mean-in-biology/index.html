Anaerobic vs Aerobic Respiration YouTube From youtube.com
The great majority of organisms produce energy molecules called atp (adenosine triphosphate) through a process of aerobic. What does the term anaerobic refer to? Molecular oxygen is the final electron acceptor. So, if you sprint 100 meter as fast as you can, practically all the energy.

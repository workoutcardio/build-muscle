<p>Coronary artery calcium () predicts coronary heart disease () events better than carotid wall plaque presence; With coronary artery disease, plaque first grows within the walls of the coronary arteries until the blood flow to the heart’s muscle is limited. Both conditions lead to decreased blood flow to other parts of the body. Coronary arteries supply blood to the heart muscle.</p>

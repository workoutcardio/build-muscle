The highlights of krebs cycle are. Therefore, aerobic respiration is the process of cellular respiration that uses oxygen to produce energy from food. Aerobic respiration is the process through which glucose is burned or oxidised in the presence of oxygen to produce energy (atp). This process includes the krebs cycle, electron transport chain, and oxidative phosphorylation.

<p>Cellular respiration involves breakdown of glucose into carbon dioxide and water in presence of oxygen, releasing energy. The process in which glucose is converted into co2 and h2o in the presence of oxygen, releasing large amounts of atp. The sugar is completely broken down to carbon dioxide and water, yielding a maximum of 38 molecules of atp per molecule of glucose. Therefore, aerobic respiration is the process of cellular respiration that uses oxygen to produce energy from food. Net yield of aerobic respiration during Krebs cycle class 11 biology CBSE.</p>

<p>This type of respiration is common in most plants and animals, including humans, birds and other mammals. Aerobic respiration is the process through which glucose is burned or oxidised in the presence of oxygen to produce energy (atp). If oxygen is present, the pyruvate produced in glycolysis is oxidized further in the krebs cycle, a continuation of aerobic respiration. Respiration is also a cellular process.

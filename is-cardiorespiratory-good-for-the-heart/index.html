<p>With the growing interest in exercise and sport and the significance of cardiovascular disease in the spinal cord injured population, the role of endurance training in improving cardiovascular health is of particular interest. It is dependent on the function of the cardiorespiratory system (heart and lungs) and the cellular metabolic capacities. Exercise has many positive effects on heart health. Exercise lowers stress hormone levels like adrenaline and cortisol in the body.</p>

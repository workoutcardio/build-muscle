What is Water Resistant Watch? Total Watch Repair From totalwatchrepair.com
The rating guarantees protection against splashes of water and light rain. The same would apply to a watch that has a water resistance of 3atm. Those are the simple and clean definitions of both 5atm, and ip68. It is important to note that this is a measure of pressure not depth.

<p>This is why a watch with 5atm water resistance has a water resistance of 50 meters. And 10atm would be ten times that pressure. Every time you get a watch wet you are running a risk of something bad happening, whether it is a $15 quartz watch or a $5000 2000 meter dive watch. The same would apply to a watch that has a water resistance of 3atm.</p>

<p>Suitable for surface swimming and snorkeling, not scuba diving. The simple answer is that 3 atm water resistant means that a watch is water resistant to a depth of 30 meters. Every 10m of depth adds one atmosphere of pressure, hence the 5atm rating of the galaxy watch active2, galaxy watch active, galaxy fit, galaxy watch, gear sport and gear fit2 pro.

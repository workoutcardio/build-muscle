Why high heart rate variability indicates good breathing From breathesimple.com
In the present study, we investigated the relation between cognitive performance and heart rate variability as a function of fitness level. Repeat steps 2 and 3 three times, for a total of 4 cycles. Heart rate variability (hrv) arises from the complex interplay of sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic regulation of heart rate. What makes heart rate variability increase?

Generally speaking, a lower heart rate suggests rest and relaxation, and a higher heart rate indicates stress, exercise or exertion.

Increase muscle strength and power. The end product of this product has a high concentration of carbon. Anaerobic exercise such as resistance training and sprinting can significantly improve measurable quantities of peak strength and power, whereas aerobic exercise is primarily used to improve endurance (time to exhaustion) and total work capacity, as measured by peak oxygen consumption or caloric expenditure. Increase muscle strength and power.

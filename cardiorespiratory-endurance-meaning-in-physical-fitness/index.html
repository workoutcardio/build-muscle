Regular physical activity, particularly aerobic exercise, has been shown to enhance cardiorespiratory endurance. 13.3 tests to assess endurance. Cardiorespiratory fitness (crf) refers to the ability of the circulatory and respiratory systems to supply oxygen to skeletal muscles during sustained physical activity. Vo 2 max is generally measured in laboratories using treadmill running, cycling, or rowing ergometers by progressively increasing intensity over a time period.

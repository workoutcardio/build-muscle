What is the anaerobic threshold? From ussa-my.com
Also, after anaerobic training such as sprinting your heart rate stays elevated for several hours. Your resting pulse naturally increases as you get older, but your maximum heart rate decreases. The anaerobic zone is 80 to 90 percent of your maximum heart rate. Anaerobic exercise is a type of exercise that breaks down glucose in the body.

To our knowledge, this was the first study to implement an mrt program into a pe setting. The main results of resistance training is improved strength, health, endurance and fitness. In this review, we present evidence for the neuroplastic effects and cognitive benefits of resistance exercise and propose some of the underlying mechanisms that drive neuroplasticity following resistance training. Background the salutary effects of resistance exercise training (ret) are well established, including increased strength and function;

<p>18 women and 28 men), were randomly assigned to training and control groups (n=23 each). With resistance training exploding in popularity because of its powerful body sculpting, muscle strengthening, metabolism boosting, fat melting and hormone balancing effects, it’s hard to imagine that it has any disadvantages. The purpose of this review was to search the body of scientific literature for original research addressing the effects of ct on distance running performance in highly competitive endurance runners. In this review, we present evidence for the neuroplastic effects and cognitive benefits of resistance exercise and propose some of the underlying mechanisms that drive neuroplasticity following resistance training.

<p>At the beginning of exercise, your body removes the parasympathetic stimulation, which enables the heart rate to gradually increase. The next question is, where do the oxygen that the muscle need comes from? Now, compare your heart rate during exercise to your maximal heart rate. The second heart may exhaust, whereas the healthy heart becomes stronger with a lower resting heart rate.</p>

<p>As we make more blood vessels, there are more places for blood to flow, which results in more efficient circulation. However, exercising at a maximum heart rate (hrmax) for each workout session does not produce significant exercise results. A young, healthy athlete may have a heart rate of 30 to 40 bpm.

<p>However, exercising at a maximum heart rate (hrmax) for each workout session does not produce significant exercise results. The cardiovascular system, consisting of the heart and blood vessels, responds to exercise with an increase in heart rate and strength of contraction with each beat, resulting in a higher cardiac output (quantity of blood pumped through the heart per unit of time). With all the attention paid to the effect that aerobic exercise has on heart rate, you might think the only requirement for an effective workout is to increase your heart rate. When you exercise, including running, your heart rate will increase, meaning that your pulse will become faster because your body is under physical stress.
